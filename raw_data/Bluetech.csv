Unlike communication in air where radio waves allow the transmission of data, voice or video wireless, a tether is required underwater to transmit similar information. The development of a new type of underwater vehicle that can send and receive data wirelessly will unlock new possibilities in ocean exploration and marine conservation as well as new economic development opportunities. This technology could provide a solution to efficiently map the seafloor, significantly improving search and rescue capabilities. Oceans cover 70% of the planet but more than 80% of the seafloor remains unmapped. This technology also could be used to better monitor offshore industrial activities and help to prevent environmental damage and ocean pollution. In addition, the vehicle could gather data that can be used to monitor ocean health and to better predict climate change. The technology may have application across all fields of the blue economy: offshore aquaculture, maritime defense, offshore energy, ocean observing and shipping. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of high-bandwidth underwater wireless data communication for seafloor mapping, environmental monitoring, underwater data collection and across all five fields of the blue economy. The technology is an underwater vehicle that can send and receive data using optical communication, which has a better range underwater than radio communication. This enables remote control the vehicle and it is possible to receive live feedback from the vehicle (e.g., live video stream) without the problems of using a tether. The vehicle also may be pre-programmed and operated in autonomous mode, and prototypes have been developed and tested in water tanks. Further development of the technology requires a better understanding of customer needs and requirements to achieve commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Marine invasive species are considered to be one of the greatest threats to marine and coastal biodiversity worldwide, second only to habitat loss. Keeping the oceans healthy is essential to preserve the employment, development and growth of the ocean economy. This is particularly relevant in the United States, where the marine economy contributes nearly $400 billion to the nation's gross domestic product with 40 percent of the population living in coastal counties. One of the main vectors for the transfer of marine invasive species is the biofouling on ship hulls, described as the undesirable accumulation of microorganisms, plants, algae and animals on the submerged hull. A second impact of biofouling is to increase the drag forces on the hull, resulting in an increase of the ship's fuel consumption and GHG emissions in the atmosphere. This project advances a system for in-water inspection of ship hulls with a fleet of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). The automated underwater inspection system will provide maritime stakeholders with biofouling data to optimize hull cleaning schedules, validate compliance with regulations, thereby improving ship performance and ecosystem health. <br/><br/>This project develops a system leveraging a UUV fleet that forms an arch operated from a vessel (e.g. power boat, crew vessel) located at one of the arch's extremities. It can inspect hulls as ships enter or leave ports without having to be immobilized. The UUVs exchange data wirelessly between each other and with the surface, enabling autonomous coordinate inspections without tethers but under human supervision. An advanced positioning system and control scheme will be implemented to enable accurate localization without GPS and precise operation in the vicinity of the hull. This project will conduct in-water experiments to validate the performance of the positioning system and control scheme. The outcome of the project will be a proof-of-concept where a fleet of two UUVs inspect the hull of a vessel, demonstrating that the inspection system is fast, practical and repeatable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, it has been understood that wastewater contains valuable resources such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Carbon in wastewater can be recovered to generate energy, while nitrogen and phosphorus recovery can supplement nutrient demand for agriculture. This conference will establish actionable roadmaps for the further development, demonstration, and implementation of technologies that intensify resource recovery at wastewater treatment plants.<br/><br/>This Conference includes realizing the full potential of resource recovery at wastewater treatment plants through active participation of all stakeholders in the development, testing, and implementation of intensifying technologies. The original paradigm of wastewater treatment to protect public health and improve environmental quality has begun to shift, and now includes sustainable energy production and resource recovery. To support this paradigm shift, the water industry must actively develop, demonstrate and implement new resource recovery technologies to maximize benefit, and reduce the cost and unintended environmental consequences of traditional wastewater treatment technologies. This conference program includes both a ""technology pull"" and a ""technology push"" strategy. Drivers for resource recovery and energy neutrality include decreased energy demand and carbon emissions, marketable commodities, and improved efficiency at reduced cost. This conference will actively engage researchers in the development and demonstration of technologies aimed at intensifying resource recovery, allowing them to lead the paradigm shift and create new opportunities for sustainable resource recovery."
