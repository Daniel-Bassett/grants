Blockchains are today the platform of choice for such needs. They offer the appealing  abstraction of a shared, totally-ordered, tamper-resistant  log of operations, implemented via  a distributed protocol run by a collection of computing nodes, each replicating the entire state of the log. While the details of these protocols vary for different blockchain implementations, they all rely on an underlying architecture that  suffers from two key limitations. First, it predicates correctness and integrity on an execution model where replicas process operations sequentially, according to the same total order; this quickly becomes a performance bottleneck. Second, it complicates deployment. The need for all replicas store the full body of data stored in the blockchain is not only resource intensive, but can be legally problematic:  GDPR laws, for instance, severely restrict where personally identifiable data (such as banking or medical records) of European citizens can reside. This project overcomes these limitations by implementing the blockchain abstraction on a novel foundation, and, in so doing, demonstrates that efficient data processing and the decentralization of trust can go hand-in-hand.  At its core is a key insight gained from prior research in databases ? namely, that is possible to implement the abstraction of a totally ordered sequence of transactions  without requiring all of their operations to be actually executed sequentially.  To leverage the opportunity for greater parallelism offered by this insight, this project  will develop the first  geo-distributed database provably resilient to malicious sabotage, whether from some of the computing nodes implementing the database or from clients of the database.  Today, there exists no rigorous  specification of what correctness would even mean in such a database; this project will introduce such correctness specification, based on the ethos of bounding the influence that malicious actors (whether among the replicas implementing the database or among its clients) can have on the outcome of transactions submitted by correct  clients. It will then  develop new algorithmic techniques that, despite adversarial attempts to the contrary, implement the blockchain abstraction while provably enforcing these correctness conditions.  To simplify deployment,  this project will focus on  drastically reducing the degree of replication necessary to support blockchains. Specifically, it will  refine the blockchain?s current threat model to decouple the degree of replication needed to ensure that no data will be lost from what is required to guarantee the integrity of the blockchain execution; this will make it possible to relax the requirement that all replicas store the entire state of the blockchain, and thus lead to easier regulatory compliance.  <br/><br/>Tighter integration among mutually untrusted parties can be transformative for a variety of applications, including healthcare, financial services, and supply chain management. Databases are natural candidates for supporting this integration, but currently lack a way to express and efficiently enforce correctness when some actors behave maliciously. This work builds that conceptual framework, leveraging a novel architecture that makes it easier to comply with data use regulations, and  instantiates it in working prototypes that will be rigorously evaluated for performance and robustness. The synergy between theory and engineering critical for the success of this project is also crucial to the education of the next generation of system engineers: they will have to negotiate issues of performance, fault-tolerance, and trust in the ubiquitous large-scale distributed systems that underpin most industries today. Proposed lecture and project materials will prepare students to apply a principled approach to building trustworthy distributed systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The lack of transparent information throughout the supply chain has eroded the trust and value of many perishable products and the brands they represent. The proposed project addresses the current issue of tracking and traceability of food products in a trusted manner. Through the development of a hybrid blockchain that is sensor aware, all the parties involved in the distribution of the goods will ensure that the food quality is maintained by entering transactions into a secure blockchain. The result is two-fold: consumers will be assured that they are getting the right goods and suppliers can trust that their products are being delivered with quality. While initially focused on the $2 billion food transaction market, the commercial potential will expand to a broader range of products that require secure traceability including consumer goods, home delivery and medical products.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop the core technology for the hybrid blockchain and test the functionality in a live commercial setting. The technology represents the first-in-class solution that leverages blockchain and DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) with integrated sensor and hybrid datasets to address the perishable nature of food products. The blockchain model will assume that a transaction is an event of data transfer and that there can be many disjointed events even on a small-scale supply chain network. For traceability, novel algorithms will be designed, making it feasible to connect disjointed events using geometry and a pseudo-Boolean function on top of a system that assigns a unique code. This implementation uses multivariate time series and node features for the meaningful aggregation and disaggregation of datasets, such as data collected by sensors and participating members. Putting such multivariate time series on the graph where participants are nodes with their pairwise relations as edges, the technology will address the novel optimization problem for efficient real-time monitoring and assist in providing further assurance of transaction integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fundamental security of the blockchain is based on distributed consensus, which assumes the system is secure as long as a certain threshold amount (greater than half) of the whole network's computing (or voting) power is honest. However, in reality, many factors can effectively change this threshold, significantly impairing blockchain security. This project aims to address these fundamental security challenges in blockchain technology by developing new theories and systems to gain a deeper understanding and guide the development of new defense solutions. The project team will investigate how clustered power in large mining pools, heterogeneous network connectivity, and malicious peer-to-peer network link manipulation can impact fundamental blockchain security. The external data feed is another fundamental security challenge towards the broader application of blockchain technology. Therefore, another goal of the project is to address the data truthfulness challenge, where external Byzantine sources may supply false inputs to the blockchain applications. <br/><br/><br/>The research activities of this project focus on three main thrusts. First, the team will examine the fundamental security properties of blockchain through the lens of modeling and analysis of consensus protocols, network connectivity, and other factors in the system, with the goal of providing quantifiable insights on fairness, liveness, and safety of blockchain operation. Second, the will investigate the use of trusted computing to enable remotely attestable policy-driven software-defined networks for defense and mitigation of routing-based attacks on blockchain.

If these organizations fail, the core integrity property is lost. Blockchains systems form the critical infrastructure and technology for decentralizing trust to multiple parties such that integrity is maintained even if some of them are malicious. Due to the value of the information stored, these systems need the ability to tolerate a significant fraction of malicious parties,  ensure these parties do not have an incentive to misbehave, and hold parties accountable and recover in case of an attack. Moreover, for scalability, these systems need to have low communication complexity, good latency, and support private transactions. Unfortunately, existing blockchain systems do not meet all of these requirements. This project makes novel scientific advances by bridging the gap between theoretical foundations and the practical aspects of blockchain consensus by considering several properties such as accountability, practical failure models, and privacy. The project's broader significance and importance include: (i) improved designs for public blockchains such as Ethereum and Zcash, industry-based permissioned blockchains such as VMware Concord, and applications such as decentralized finance and Central Banking Digital Currencies, (ii) a comprehensive education, dissemination, and outreach plan resulting in (a) new graduate and undergraduate courses with open-source materials, (b) the mentoring of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students ? especially from underrepresented minorities in computing, and (c) organizing events that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration on blockchains.<br/><br/>The project exploits and reveals synergies between distributed computing, theory, privacy, game theory, and computer systems. It answers fundamental research questions on 1) defining and studying mechanisms for fault detection and recovery and how they act as a feedback loop to the security and efficiency of the system, 2) designing secure and efficient self-stabilizing synchronous protocols tolerating minority corruption, 3) analyzing consensus in the presence of rational parties, and 4) understanding the limits of and designing randomized privacy mechanisms for privacy-preserving proof-of-stake protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research builds on the architecture of the digital currency Bitcoin. It develops distributed data ledgers - similar to bookkeeping ledgers - that maintain data history so it can't be manipulated by hackers trying to hide their activities. Data consistency guarantees  that everyone gets the right answers about where, who, and what regardless of which ledger is read.  This software advances the security of computing systems by making data accountable, especially for online commerce and big data (""the cloud'').  It secures forensic information taken from compromised computers  for further analysis. It validates whether privacy requirements are being met for medical records.  The key outcome is a software prototype that implements the complete system and illustrates the ability to store, maintain, and update provenance information for real data. <br/><br/>A data provenance framework will be designed, prototyped, evaluated and then delivered as an Application Programmer Interface, software library, and distributed service. This work will produce a reusable distributed service architecture achieving scalability by using distributed services that maintain ledger information. The system leverages Bitcoin cryptocurrency by building on Bitcoin's block-chain architecture to maintain provenance metadata securely. It leverages existing tools for provenance data exploration and visualization.  Digital signatures from both the server/system as well as the user creates dual information about possession, while distributed ledgers remove control and maintenance of metadata from the user who creates it. The prototype enables research into long-term provenance creation, maintenance, and utilization for workflows in the area of cybersecurity as well  studies of how to integrate and secure provenance into existing file systems and network services.  Opt-in and passive (involuntary) provenance systems will be enabled using the API, library, and distributed ledgers prototyped, enabling data provenance for systems where needed, notably high assurance cloud computing and scientific workflow systems.

An Internet of Things-based framework for the healthcare industry is called the Internet of Medical Things.  This technology connects patients to their physicians and supports the transfer of medical data over the Internet.  Concerns about the privacy of data transmitted over the Internet and network security are challenges facing all applications of the Internet of Things concept, but they can be exacerbated by the knowledge gap between the designers of the frameworks and the end users in the medical field.  As the healthcare industry grows to meet the needs of an aging population, the workforce that designs Internet of Medical Things devices and the networks that connect them must be ready to address these privacy and security concerns.

The use of blockchain technology drives efficiencies in direct alignment with improved patient experience and improved health, both at a reduced cost. The economic impact of bringing down the costs of providing healthcare has the potential to benefit millions of lives. One serious threat on Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains is the double-spend attack. With a successful double-spend attack, miners can reverse payments and obscure the audit trail of data access. The deployment of the proposed protocol will ensure the integrity of both these properties. More broadly, the proposed system can improve security for any PoW blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The system can also greatly improve user experience by processing in a timely and standard manner via regularly created blocks.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase II project proposes to virtually remove the threat of double-spends for healthcare safe blockchains. Existing PoW blockchains are based on computational puzzles. Once a miner solves a puzzle, she adds a block to the chain and is rewarded with coins. In expectation, miners produce blocks proportional to their share of the computational resources. But mining is a random process and occasionally a miner with a small share of the resources can generate a majority of the blocks. In those cases, a minority miner can overwrite existing blocks, nullifying or double-spending earlier entries. The proposed system prevents double-spend attacks by requiring miners to aggregate multiple solutions to the PoW problem before submitting a block. This aggregation ensures that miners with the majority of the processing power have a high probability of submitting the majority of the blocks, reducing the risk of double-spends by orders of magnitude. The technical work includes:  First, developing a new consensus mechanism for blockchains. The consensus mechanism is a highly sensitive, embedded piece of software and this adoption will be handled with careful engineering. Second, the project will decrease associated bandwidth use on the network, a primary cost. The project will seek to create a new solution for reducing network costs based on advanced filters. Third, the project will address and mitigate remaining security issues, such as proof withholding attacks and Denial of Service attacks. Finally, the work will empirically quantify the improvements to ensure high quality engineering and to inform translation strategy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Leveraging blockchain for data access can drive an identified $100 billion in savings. However, while an estimated 40% of senior finance executives expect their firm to invest in blockchain over the next 2 years because of its transformational qualities, the transaction speed of blockchain needs to be improved.

While the blockchain technology has emerged as the foundational technology for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has far-reaching implications in numerous societal settings (such as in healthcare, supply-chains, and the Internet-of-Things) due to its ability to maintain authoritative records in a fully decentralized, secure, and trustless manner. However, despite being such a promising technology, one of the main roadblocks in the proliferation of blockchain applications is that current blockchain designs are resource-intensive, in terms of storage, computation, and communication. The goal of this project is to develop a novel framework and a toolkit of protocols for enabling resource-constrained computers to play a vital role in ensuring the security properties of the decentralized system. The resource-constrained blockchain architectures developed over the course of this research will enable innovative blockchain solutions for Internet-of-Things, healthcare, supply-chains, and beyond, which will be of direct benefit to society. The techniques developed in this research will have a significant impact on how low-power mobile devices can participate in today's cryptocurrency networks, which will facilitate the mass adoption of the technology. The proposed work will be seamlessly integrated into education through course development and mentoring and will be disseminated to industry and at academic blockchain events.<br/><br/>This proposal takes a principled and foundational approach to cutting down the resources consumed by large-scale blockchain systems. This proposal will develop novel blockchain architectures by taking a novel resource-centric approach and will combine cutting-edge techniques from cryptocurrencies with innovative ideas from coding and information theory and peer-to-peer networking to address several fundamental challenges in reducing the resource consumption in large-scale blockchain systems without compromising system security. In particular, the focus of the research is on (i) developing coding-theoretic architectures that limit the growth of storage space per node as a function of the size of the blockchain without affecting the security of bootstrapping new nodes; (ii) designing methodologies to empower computationally-constrained devices to 'collaboratively validate' blocks in a secure manner with a sub-linear number of computations in the size of a block; and (iii) developing a framework to analyze blockchain networks as content distribution networks, and thereby, allow network-constrained devices to optimize their network resources. The proposed architectures will be evaluated by integrating them with real-world blockchain systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, in the manufacturing sector, IIoT systems are often deployed in harsh and complex environments and have to satisfy system-level dependability, timing performance, energy-efficiency, and security requirements. Moreover, IIoT technology can be leveraged to optimize the quality of products and the productivity of manufacturing lines and avoid process anomalies and faults that can lead to subpar performance and safety issues. However, these unique opportunities brought by IIoT pose challenges in their communication fabric design, distributed data management, analysis and decision making, and security protection. This CCRI planning proposal describes the planning activities underpinning the design of an innovative software-defined IIoT infrastructure to be jointly deployed at the three participating institutions, which will serve as a unified test-bed for a broad range of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) researchers. It is envisioned that this proposed infrastructure will enable and support a large number of IIoT related research projects in the broader CISE community. It will vastly advance the adoption of IIoT technology, accelerate the transformation of legacy communication infrastructure to advanced networking and computing infrastructure, and boost the nation's economic growth and competitiveness.<br/><br/>The proposed novel IIoT community infrastructure is motivated by the observed limitations of existing IIoT test-beds in the research community. These limitations include (i) a lack of deployment in real-life manufacturing environments and (ii) the inability to support heterogeneous network structures and scalable network management and data analytics. To address these limitations, this project will utilize established community outreach venues to reach out to the relevant CISE research communities to best understand the community needs and their expectations for the proposed infrastructure.  The proposed IIoT community research infrastructure will be the first of its kind that (a) combines software-defined networking (SDN) backbone and software-defined radio (SDR)-based real-time wireless edge networks into a hybrid communication fabric to emulate a variety of industrial networking environments; (b) provides a hierarchical real-time computing platform for real-time IIoT system monitoring, analysis and decision making; and (c) organizes the edge computing facilities deployed at individual sites into a multi-site IIoT Blockchain network to support research on distributed data management technologies. The flexibility and configurability of the proposed infrastructure at both device and system levels will enable diverse communities of CISE researchers to access the test-bed, deploy their protocols, algorithms and applications, and experimentally validate new ideas and innovations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cities, states and regions, business, investors and civil society (non-state actors) are increasingly recognized for their ability to catalyze, implement, and innovate climate actions. In some cases, these efforts go beyond or are more ambitious than national governments' commitments. Quantitatively assessing and tracking these efforts, however, is fraught with difficulties, due to heterogeneous data sources and gaps in data coverage. These data challenges inhibit the capacity of non-state actors and national governments to acquire and integrate knowledge -- about effective strategies or potential opportunities to coordinate or complement efforts -- into their policy processes. Blockchains are decentralized and immutable ledgers that have the potential to address accounting and knowledge gaps, including double-counting problems (e.g., most prominently in digital currencies). To date, however, there is a lack of a clear understanding and concrete frameworks for how this technology can be applied to the challenge of establishing accountability and incentives for climate actors. A blockchain or distributed ledger approach could fill a critical gap in the understanding of how non-state climate actions are implemented, what they achieve, and how to build a sustainable system that lowers measurement and reporting burdens to be more inclusive globally.  <br/><br/>This project will develop a trusted and decentralized data management and accounting scheme for non-state action pledges as a way of enhancing the scientific basis for non-state and subnational climate action and policy. Using an interdisciplinary approach that will leverage insights from academic researchers, industry partners, non-state and subnational climate action practitioners, and policymakers, it will innovate a novel framework and architecture for Blockchain Climate Action Tracking (B-CAT). This framework, developed in both theory and tested in proof-of-concept prototypes, will be used to define if and where blockchain and complementary technologies (e.g., internet-of-things) can improve upon existing efforts tracking climate policy. The project will answer four main questions: 1) Who are the primary actors, verifiers and users that will participate in the B-CAT ecosystem and what requirements might they have for engagement? 2) How can distributed ledger technology (e.g., blockchain) be applied to automate incentive schemes and protocols that can address identified data and knowledge gaps in non-state climate action? 3) What are the potential impacts and challenges in the science of tracking climate action with this new blockchain framework? 4) Where can blockchain tools provide significant value in climate use-cases, and what issues and architectural considerations would need to be addressed for these to be applied effectively and at scale? Identifying explicit limitations and positive implications of the technology will also be an important output of this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It permits ""trust"" without trusted third-parties or mediators. In addition, Bitcoin and systems like it are membership-based means of value transfer and only work if people actively join them. This project examines new forms of private digital currency, exploring shifts in blockchain-based systems, and how innovators and regulators have participated in, advanced, and challenged them. The research examines how a new cadre of corporate and regulatory professionals are creating, understanding, monitoring, and regulating blockchain-based experiments in payment and in legal services.  Studying the interface between law and technology, this research is important not just for what it will reveal about law and regulation in the context of rapid technological change. It is also important because innovations with the bitcoin protocol raise broad questions about the changing nature of money, property, and law, and throw open for debate questions lawmakers thought settled at the end of the 19th century about the state's role in issuing money and the nature of contract. Broader impacts include training of graduate students and the creation and opening of a public-facing portal to a database and archive of compiled regulatory, policy, and industry documents.  <br/><br/>As bitcoin-like systems move into the domain of law to create law-like substitutes, this research is designed to answer several questions.  Do new digital currencies create new social and economic exclusions? What do these innovations say about changing understandings of money and law? What happens when new corporate entrants into payment imagine they are innovating in money, not just its transmission, and seek to ""disrupt"" not just payment, but professions like notaries and escrow agents? How do regulators respond to concomitant challenges to the public interest in payment and in law itself?  The principal research activities are interviews with lawyers, regulators, and payments industry professionals, participant-observation at industry conferences, and code walkthroughs during which the researcher will follow programmers as they build new functionality into the blockchain."

Large manufacturing and energy enterprises are comprised of multiple plants sites spread across different geographical locations. These plants contain critical processes and equipment that are monitored using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Predictive analytics, a key component in digital transformation, targets the analysis of large volumes of industrial data to generate insights to improve the efficiency of industrial operations, optimize processes, and reduce the life cycle costs of critical equipment and machinery. The prevailing solutions in today?s market rely on using the Cloud to consolidate data, perform analytics, and extract valuable insights. This process creates significant delays for many industrial processes that require immediate insights into their critical operations. The process is also not suitable for companies that have heightened security and privacy protocols (such as nuclear plants and defense manufacturing). The company seeks to enable companies to conduct predictive analytics on geographically distributed data silos without the need to move data from its location, thus reducing decision latency. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a technology stack that leverages the blockchain to train advanced analytic algorithms and Machine Learning models across data silos in different locations without relying on the Cloud or any corporate server.  Specifically, the project targets the innovative integration of the blockchain Smart Contracts with distributed memory programming frameworks like the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This integration raises several interesting research challenges one of which requires designing basic primitives similar in functionality to a Map-Reduce framework for the blockchain. The second research component revolves around the development of novel algorithmic decomposition schemes for popular Machine Learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) models to facilitate their training in a decentralized manner using the blockchain. If successful, this technology may provide analytic insights faster than the Cloud. It may also significantly reduce the cost and labor associated with implementing and deploying industrial analytics. Data science teams will be provided with the agility and flexibility to modify and redeploy algorithms without having to rebuild and redesign data pipeline infrastructure to a centralized server.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For society at large, the ability to uncover the most complex money laundering and fraud schemes will help cut the flow of funds to the worst actors using cryptocurrency: organized crime, narcotics dealers, child pornographers, human traffickers, terrorists, and rogue nations.

In doing so, it will secure cryptocurrency systems and advance the fields of network analysis and visualization, which will be needed to understand the schemes. There are three major technical hurdles in the Phase I project. First, the proposed implementation and infrastructure for the network tracing algorithms need to be scaled up to trace the entire Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains in real-time. Second, to be able to trace addresses to known illicit accounts, a sufficient number of these accounts need to be identified. The proposed project will develop software for cross referencing account addresses with both on-chain and clear and dark web activity to build the lists of known bad actor addresses.  Third, for customers to believe the results of the analysis, a network visualization tool to show the chains of custody linking a suspect account to a known illicit account must be created.

Such collections are made possible by advances in computer technology such as sensors which collect data such as humidity, air quality and so forth, and powerful computer systems that analyze the data. The increased use of data for scientific research poses some important challenges. Data can have errors which impact conclusions derived from the data. Scientific research has to be reproducible to support validation and detection of scientific misconduct. Addressing these challenges requires tracking data used in research projects. Examples include: tracking the source that originated the data -- for example a mobile phone that acquired some images- and its geographic location; tracking which computer systems processed the data; tracking how scientists modified given data. Such a set of information is referred to as provenance -- very much like the provenance of artistic artifacts. Managing provenance is technically complex; yet it is key for data-intensive research. This project makes important advances in this direction by developing software systems for securely managing provenance. <br/><br/>This project develops a provenance management system for cyberinfrastructure that includes different types of hosts, devices, and data management systems. The proof-of-concept system, referred to as Cyber-provenance Infrastructure for Sensor-based Data-Intensive Research (CY-DIR), will support scientists throughout the life-cycle of their sensor-based data collection processes, including the continuous monitoring of sensors to ensure that provenance is collected and recorded, and the traceable use and processing of the data across different data management systems. CY-DIR provides researchers with provenance and metadata about data being collected by sensors. Provenance security will be assured by the use of efficient encryption techniques for use in sensors, secure logging techniques, and secure processors. Research from this project will provide novel results in several areas: provenance techniques for sensor data; cryptographic key management for sensors, mobile devices, and unmanned aircraft systems; provenance aware streaming data processing techniques; protection of provenance data against tempering; provenance data integration across different data management systems."

However, current blockchain systems suffer from severe scalability limitations. For example, blockchain-based digital currencies have orders of magnitude worse transaction throughput and confirmation latency than the established payment systems we use in our daily lives.  This project proposes to tackle this fundamental scalability challenge by investigating so-called ""payment channel networks"".  A payment channel network enables participants to transfer funds securely through a set of intermediaries, without recording every transaction on a public ledger (the blockchain).  This project starts with the observation that payment channel networks have similarities to data communication networks (and also important differences), but their designs are primitive by comparison. The goal this research is to develop network protocols for payment channel networks --- protocols that are tailor-made for these networks while being deeply rooted in decades of research on data networks. If successful, this project would enable principled, efficient, and cost-effective approaches to building decentralized payment systems and improving the scalability of many blockchain systems.  <br/><br/>A central challenge for a payment channel network is how to route payments across the network efficiently. Routing payments is non-trivial since it requires finding paths with sufficient funds and keeping payment channel funds balanced. Payment channels used more frequently in one direction eventually run out of funds in that direction blocking further transactions through them. Inefficient routing limits network throughput and increases transaction costs, as it forces routers to deposit a large amount of funds into their payment channels up front, or pay high transaction fees to repeatedly rebalance payment channels on the blockchain. This research seeks to develop a new payment channel network that achieves high transaction throughput at low cost. To this end, the researchers plan to (1) develop a packet-switched payment channel network architecture, (2) invent imbalance-aware routing and rate control algorithms with theoretical guarantees, and (3) investigate privacy and incentive-compatibility of payment channel network protocols.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results could include 60% cost reduction compared to traditional money transfer systems, <30 second transaction completions, and a 0% fraud rate. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to research and develop a blockchain-based money management solution to store, send, and exchange money without a smartphone or internet. Leaf?s core technology includes a blockchain back-end that powers an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) front-end, allowing mobile devices to securely send and receive data without an internet connection. Custodial wallets on a public blockchain will provide a transparent and secure ledger. Custom digital representations of value (tokens) pegged to fiat currencies allow portability of assets without exposing users to speculative cryptocurrency risks. In conjunction with a novel identity management system, this solution will create economic identities for users without forfeiting control of sensitive data. Research will evaluate blockchain as a method of legally-compliant money storage and transfer, integrated with the fiat system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A blockchain is a massively distributed, append-only log of transactions that is cryptographically protected from tampering. Thanks to their capacity towards facilitating fast and inexpensive transactions across the globe and their powerful scripting-language support for complex financial instruments, blockchains have already proven to be a highly disruptive force in the finance and e-commerce sectors. Nevertheless, at least two major hurdles still stand in the way of mainstream blockchain acceptance: 1) 'traditional' blockchain architectures are not sufficiently scalable to handle the ever-growing base of blockchain users and the resulting proliferation of transactions, and 2) despite myriad efforts to improve blockchain privacy, users of public blockchains remain susceptible to devastating attacks on the privacy of their accounts and transactions, which often lead to security breaches causing financial losses for the victims. The approaches explored in this project provide privacy for blockchain users where previous efforts have failed by rethinking the one-size-fits-all approach of using Tor to solve all problems requiring anonymity and/or unlinkability. Indeed, running complex protocols over Tor is fraught with risks and can open users to subtle-yet-devastating deanonymization attacks; the tailor-made solutions developed in this project leverage domain-specific knowledge to mitigate these risks.<br/><br/>The project addresses privacy concerns as they relate both to traditional blockchain transactions and to newer 'payment channel network' transactions. Payment channel networks promise greatly improved scalability by allowing secure (off-chain) payment requiring no interaction with the blockchain ledger. In the context of traditional blockchain transactions, this research develops innovative ways to 1) privately publish transactions to a blockchain by integrating tailor-made anonymous communication protocols directly into the blockchain communication infrastructure, and 2) privately retrieve transactions from a blockchain using carefully optimized private information retrieval (PIR) protocols that support expressive blockchain queries. In the context of payment channel networks, the project 1) explores the (im)possibility of performing off-chain transactions privately, and 2) develops a new theoretical framework and toolkit of algorithms for ensuring availability and quality of service for payment channel transactions in extreme adversarial conditions. Additionally, as part of this project, the multi-institution and transnational team of PIs are deploying a distributed instantiation of the new private blockchain transaction retrieval solutions, which will be open to use by the public. Along with training graduate students, the project puts a major emphasis on undergraduate involvement in this emerging area of blockchain research."

Blockchains are today the platform of choice for such needs. They offer the appealing  abstraction of a shared, totally-ordered, tamper-resistant  log of operations, implemented via  a distributed protocol run by a collection of computing nodes, each replicating the entire state of the log. While the details of these protocols vary for different blockchain implementations, they all rely on an underlying architecture that  suffers from two key limitations. First, it predicates correctness and integrity on an execution model where replicas process operations sequentially, according to the same total order; this quickly becomes a performance bottleneck. Second, it complicates deployment. The need for all replicas store the full body of data stored in the blockchain is not only resource intensive, but can be legally problematic:  GDPR laws, for instance, severely restrict where personally identifiable data (such as banking or medical records) of European citizens can reside. This project overcomes these limitations by implementing the blockchain abstraction on a novel foundation, and, in so doing, demonstrates that efficient data processing and the decentralization of trust can go hand-in-hand.  At its core is a key insight gained from prior research in databases ? namely, that is possible to implement the abstraction of a totally ordered sequence of transactions  without requiring all of their operations to be actually executed sequentially.  To leverage the opportunity for greater parallelism offered by this insight, this project  will develop the first  geo-distributed database provably resilient to malicious sabotage, whether from some of the computing nodes implementing the database or from clients of the database.  Today, there exists no rigorous  specification of what correctness would even mean in such a database; this project will introduce such correctness specification, based on the ethos of bounding the influence that malicious actors (whether among the replicas implementing the database or among its clients) can have on the outcome of transactions submitted by correct  clients. It will then  develop new algorithmic techniques that, despite adversarial attempts to the contrary, implement the blockchain abstraction while provably enforcing these correctness conditions.  To simplify deployment,  this project will focus on  drastically reducing the degree of replication necessary to support blockchains. Specifically, it will  refine the blockchain?s current threat model to decouple the degree of replication needed to ensure that no data will be lost from what is required to guarantee the integrity of the blockchain execution; this will make it possible to relax the requirement that all replicas store the entire state of the blockchain, and thus lead to easier regulatory compliance.  <br/><br/>Tighter integration among mutually untrusted parties can be transformative for a variety of applications, including healthcare, financial services, and supply chain management. Databases are natural candidates for supporting this integration, but currently lack a way to express and efficiently enforce correctness when some actors behave maliciously. This work builds that conceptual framework, leveraging a novel architecture that makes it easier to comply with data use regulations, and  instantiates it in working prototypes that will be rigorously evaluated for performance and robustness. The synergy between theory and engineering critical for the success of this project is also crucial to the education of the next generation of system engineers: they will have to negotiate issues of performance, fault-tolerance, and trust in the ubiquitous large-scale distributed systems that underpin most industries today. Proposed lecture and project materials will prepare students to apply a principled approach to building trustworthy distributed systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, blockchains are also recognized for their potential advantages in various contexts ranging from identity management to health data records. However, despite being such a promising tool, the data posted on a blockchain is public and immortally captured and thus the privacy of the users can be massively violated if privacy concerns are not taken into consideration. The goals of this project are to develop a formal model for privacy in blockchains and privacy-preserving tools.<br/><br/>This project develops a framework that captures privacy requirements for transactions, data blocks and the mining process under a threat model that reflects the adversarial capabilities over the Internet (i.e., composable security). Building on this framework, the researchers investigate new privacy-preserving mechanisms for existing blockchain payment systems and the design of new blockchain-based payment systems with built-in privacy properties that do not require a trusted setup.  Next, the researchers investigate new privacy requirements like hiding the identity of the miner which is relevant in scenarios where mining a block might signify the endorsement of the information included in the block. Finally, the researchers develop techniques to guarantee accountability even in a privacy-preserving setting where privacy should be preserved only so long as a pre-specified bad behavior is not detected."

Timed data release ensures that data remains secure and undiscovered until a prescribed release time and gets automatically released at the release time. Examples of applications requiring timed data release include secure auction systems (bidding information needs protection until all bids arrive), copyrights-aware data publishing (data is automatically released when the copyright expires) and secure voting mechanisms (votes are not allowed to be accessed until the end of the polling process). This project develops a highly decentralized solution for supporting timed release of data using Blockchain-based smart contracts that provide guaranteed protection against adversarial attacks on obtaining access to the data before the release time. This research also augments the timed data release techniques with mechanisms for decentralized timed transactions that enable scheduling of transaction functions without revealing the function inputs prior to the execution time. The project aims to produce the techniques, algorithms, design and implementation to enable timed release of data and timed execution in decentralized blockchain platforms. Research results from the project will be integrated into the security track courses at the University of Pittsburgh. The project will engage the security track students in the proposed research and development activities. New teaching modules related to blockchain-based decentralized application development will be incorporated as introductory modules for high school students. <br/> <br/>The project takes a transformational step towards building next generation decentralized infrastructures for supporting timed data release and timed execution of transactions that do not involve a single point of trust. A key aspect to this model is a suite of novel secure data management techniques that allows data to be published at a future time point without a single point of trust (i.e., the data becomes available at the release time and prior to the release time, it remains undiscovered and unavailable). The timed-release mechanisms route the protected data within the timed data release system in a deterministically pseudo-random manner, enabling it to automatically appear at the release time. The proposed techniques use a monetary incentive mechanism enforced by the blockchain to reward honest peers and penalize violators of the protocol. The mechanisms are designed to protect against both rational and malicious peers in the system. A key objective of the system design is to minimize the gas cost of executing the timed data release and timed execution protocols while maintaining high scalability and availability. The project demonstrates the use of timed data release and timed execution features by developing a suite of decentralized applications using the proposed techniques. The project implements the mechanisms using the contract-oriented programming language, Solidity and evaluates the techniques on the Rinkeby Ethereum test network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern blockchains rely on incentives for cooperative behavior differently than do classical distributed systems, such as our traditional banking system. Decentralized blockchains usually rely on a native cryptocurrency to motivate independent actors to run them correctly, whereas classical distributed systems are typically deployed in directed and closed environments. There is therefore an urgent need to develop rigorous foundations of the economic and incentive factors in blockchains and cryptocurrencies in general.  The project team is also developing new and freely available educational materials on blockchains, in order to make this important but complex topic more accessible to all.<br/><br/>The project has three research thrusts.  The first thrust concerns transaction fee mechanism design (that is, how to select which pending transactions are included for execution on the blockchain, and at what prices).  The goals here are to understand the welfare and revenue approximation guarantees for different transaction fee mechanisms, to leverage cryptographic primitives to overcome impossibility results, and to achieve robustness to long-term collusion by cartels of block producers.  The second thrust pursues cryptographic protocols that possess strong game-theoretic guarantees, with a focus on the design of cryptographic mechanisms that are resilient to side contracts and game-theoretically fair multi-party computation.  The final thrust investigates how to design decentralized blockchains with desirable economic properties.  Specific goals here include determining simple modifications to Nakamoto consensus that improve its security, formulating a definition of economic security against liveness (as opposed to safety) attacks, and rigorously comparing the economic security offered by proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms.

Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger. The IoT is a system of interconnected computing devices on which the emergence of 5G technology has an accelerating effect. The M2M economy is a collection of machines acting as economic agents that autonomously interact through sequences of transactions. Blockchain technology enables the registry of these transactions whose logic is articulated and coded in the form of smart contracts. These technologies have transformational potential and hold the promise of unprecedented economic growth, but they come with many vulnerabilities. This research contributes to the progress of science, advancement of prosperity and welfare, and securing the national defense through a new mechanism to enable security and cost efficient interactions on M2M platforms. The novel idea is to design market incentives such that services among machines are bought and sold based not only on their cost but also on the cyber-riskiness of the devices providing those services.<br/><br/>The project envisions decentralized systems that are self-adapting to cyber-risk and facilitate security and cost efficient interactions on platforms based on blockchain and IoT. The challenges are lack of: (a) real-time market design and self-optimization mechanisms; (b) scalable approaches for real-time attack identification across programs and high-level logics; (c) methods to assess M2M specific attack impact. Responding to these challenges, this project interprets the problem of creating a cyber-secure and economically efficient IoT/blockchain-based ecosystem as one of designing large-scale interconnected markets. Each of these markets has a price adjustment mechanism that may discriminate based on real-time cyber-risk. Collectively, these markets give rise to an overall emergent property of cyber-risks and economic efficiency self-adaptive optimization. Vulnerability assessment is the key to generate cyber-risk and price appropriate adjustments. This project comprehensively assesses M2M specific vulnerabilities by articulating attack graphs, hence contributing to characterizing the cyber-risk of decentralized applications for smart contract platforms. By using tools of random graph theory and percolation theory, the project provides a representative mathematical framework for understanding the cyber-risk of a IoT/blockchain-based ecosystem.

There are innovative public or private blockchain solutions for supply chains, the ""Internet of Things"", and beyond. In our highly inter-connected world, it is inevitable that these solutions will soon have to interact with each other. Similar to the Internet today, this will eventually result in formation of a network of blockchains where transactions flow across disparate blockchains. Some ad hoc industrial efforts have already begun in this direction; however, the scientific rigor is missing, and privacy and availability issues are pervasive. This project formally defines inter-blockchain communication (IBC) notions offering different privacy and availability trade-offs and securely realizes those notions toward real-world use by developing low-overhead cryptographic and/or crypto-economic solutions. The project's novelties includes careful abstractions of IBC primitives, efficient protocol designs offering innovative trade-offs between privacy and availability, and security analyses for the proposed tools and protocols. As the blockchains get connected over the coming years, numerous advances, particularly in the form of access technologies (e.g., blockchain counterparts of Internet transport protocols) will emerge, and the project's broader significance and importance includes offering robust, secure, and privacy-preserving communication platforms for development of these advanced technologies.

The project also studies the inverse relationships between privacy and non-blocking progress, and non-source routing and wormhole attacks, and develops a privacy-aware blueprint and open-source code-base that can form the basis of the transactions across the blockchains. The investigators actively interact with the blockchain community (in the form of publications, seminars, workshops, and course materials) to demonstrate the severity of privacy and availability vulnerabilities, and to promote the developed solutions. By improving fundamental understanding of privacy and availability of IBC, this project enables its end-to-end security that will ultimately enhance public confidence in the technology underlying the internet of blockchains and will lead to its rapid acceptance for decentralized and highly-available asset tracking across different domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The researcher will focus on U.S. ranches that have adopted blockchain, the record-keeping mechanism underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Agriculture is among the first sectors of the U.S. economy to implement blockchain in real-world cases unrelated to cryptocurrency. Historically, ranchers have proven ownership and controlled movement of cattle through a combination of branding and barbed wire, both of which had significant social impacts beyond cattle husbandry. Beef producers are now testing blockchain?s promise of making detailed transactional information publicly available, aiming to enable consumers to self-verify the provenance and quality of their food rather than placing trust in often opaque supply chains. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of scientific data collection and analysis, explores the motivations and potential social ramifications of cutting-edge technology adoption. <br/><br/>The project tests the hypothesis that the infrastructure of meat production is primarily organized around notions of risk. Some uncertainties inherent to food production, such as weather, are practically impossible to predict; others, such as predation loss or negligence liability, are to a greater extent predictable. Predictable losses can be quantified as risk and thus managed through insurance or other means of transfer. The investigator will perform observational research among cowhands, conduct interviews with lawmakers and technology promoters, and undertake archival research, inquiring into the context and motivation for the use of branding, barbed wire, and blockchain as provenance technologies that increase certainty of ownership. This inquiry will reveal the distribution of risk across the beef supply chain, including who bears the burdens of risk and who is able to leverage it to generate value. The research will contribute to a greater understanding of how risk is conceived of and commodified. The far-reaching impacts of such an understanding include the safety of the US meat supply, the general configuration of supply chains, and the relationship between agricultural innovation and notions of ownership and responsibility with respect to property.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consumers have growing interest in supporting sustainable and environmentally friendly food and energy production practices. They will consider paying more for products that contribute towards cleaner air, water, and natural environments if they can be assured sustainability goals are being met. Farmers and suppliers are also interested in improving field-to-market supply chains. Advances in information technology and computational systems could allow farmers and suppliers to keep track of their practices in ways that consumers can incentivize. Blockchain networks are a computational approach to securely storing and sharing records that could fill this role. However, our scientific understanding of how blockchains could work to increase consumer awareness of sustainable products, incentivize farmer participation in sustainable practices, and lead to a dynamic system with long-term environmental benefits is limited. This project will evaluate the feasibility of blockchain networks to connect farmers to consumers and thereby increase agricultural practices that improve sustainability. Broader impacts from this study will include the development of fundamental mechanisms and metrics for the design and prototype of blockchain networks in agricultural and other industries. Curricular materials will be developed to educate K-12 teachers and underrepresented minority students on the engineering aspects of blockchain networks to better prepare them for future technological advances. Additionally, these materials will be incorporated into the People in Ecosystems Watershed Integration (PEWI) model for use in K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>The project will develop a framework for blockchain networks that connects farmers and suppliers to consumers in a field-to-market supply chain. The framework investigates optimal blockchain network designs in terms of economic cost, accessibility, energy use, and information efficiency. Some of the factors that will be considered include the network structure, the information storage medium, and the transaction model. The optimal design will also account for consumer and farmer acceptance to encourage broad participation. The driving hypothesis is that consumers will be willing to pay higher prices for products when the incentive can be traced directly to the original supplier. The findings could lead to novel approaches for developing market-driven incentive systems that empower consumers to support sustainable practices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthcare institutions, including hospitals, clinics, and medical imaging centers, often encounter difficulties in sharing medical images across different systems and facilities. Further, most healthcare systems face concerns related to data security and patient privacy. Consequently, many organizations resort to antiquated CD-based methods for medical image sharing, incurring high costs, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities.  The proposed platform enables standardized and secure sharing of medical images, eliminating the need for physical media for medical image sharing.  The goal for the proposed technology is to facilitate faster, secure, and interoperable medical image sharing. By streamlining medical image sharing, healthcare professionals may collaborate more effectively, leading to improved patient care and outcomes. In addition, rapid and secure access to medical images across different healthcare settings may expedite diagnoses, enable timely treatment decisions, and reduce medical errors. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a blockchain-powered medical image storage and sharing platform.  The platform's architecture includes components such as smart contracts, encryption mechanisms, and decentralized storage systems, which collectively enable seamless and trustworthy medical image sharing. The use of smart contracts provides a reliable framework for access control and data sharing permissions. The encryption mechanisms safeguard sensitive patient information during transmission and storage, bolstering data security and privacy. Additionally, the utilization of decentralized storage systems ensures redundant and distributed data storage, mitigating the risk of data loss, manipulation, or security threats. The research underlying this project involves leveraging blockchain's inherent properties of decentralization, immutability, and transparency to establish a secure and interoperable infrastructure for medical image exchange. By harnessing the potential of distributed ledger technology, the proposed platform addresses the existing challenges of fragmented systems, limited interoperability, and data silos in medical image sharing.

Data sharing and reuse increases revenue streams and allows companies to realize a 8-15x return on investment in improved products and services. Despite these benefits, growth in data sharing is stymied because approximately 60% of companies are unable to access needed data, and only about 30% have taken first steps towards data sharing to realize its potential returns. The major challenges of widespread sharing are ?messy"" data and the legal issues surrounding ownership and utilization. Some organizations have addressed these challenges internally with ?feature stores,? which support data processing pipelines that extract insights. While the current generation of feature stores works well for a single organization, their centralized design assumes a level of trust absent across multiple organizations.  This proposed work will develop a feature store that supports the trust requirements needed for inter-organizational workflows to enable realizing the significant returns from data sharing.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to implement a decentralized feature store (DeFS) by solving two primary technical challenges. First, a DeFS requires fast, reliable, and provably correct data storage. While layer-1 blockchain storage is provably correct, it does not provide the required write speed nor long-term availability if miners abandon it. This project's proposed approach will meet the reliability requirement by signing data on a virtual blockchain that can span and migrate between layer-1 blockchains. The continuity of the virtual blockchain allows it to survive as layer-1 chains fail and improve as new chains come online.  Moreover, the virtual blockchain meets speed requirements by creating virtual blocks quickly on a private blockchain and periodically migrating to layer-1. Second, a DeFS requires integrating multiple data sources and pipeline code without leaking either. While interactive proof techniques satisfy privacy, they do not scale to large data sets. This project will support data processing pipelines, such as data wrangling and model fitting, by developing a scalable and secure computing framework. The framework preserves the privacy of both data and pipeline code evaluated on virtualized trusted execution environments and controlled by a trustless distributed protocol built around a virtual blockchain commitment scheme.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To bridge this gap, this project introduces secure frameworks that are specific for promoting scalability and efficiency of blockchain-based resource markets, but generic enough to be used with any service type. The project?s novelties include, first, developing a secure architecture and protocols for sidechains (secondary chains tied to a main blockchain) that have a dependence relation with the mainchain and which permit exchanging arbitrary data. And second, introducing a provable security paradigm for formalizing and analyzing security of resource markets and sidechains. The project?s impacts include achieving secure and efficient schemes that permit utilizing the advantages of blockchains in real-world applications, developing foundational understanding of sidechain covering new dependency models and previously-unexplored use cases, and promoting provable-security of large-scale distributed systems. The investigator integrates their research in both undergraduate and graduate level courses, is committed to mentoring and advising students at all levels, and works closely with under-represented groups in computer science.<br/><br/>The project involves four directions. First, chainBoost, a scheme that expedites service delivery, reduces the amount of data to be logged on the blockchain, and extends system capability while preserving compatibility. Second, chainScale, a scheme for improving scalability in terms of throughput and number of supported users. This is done by splitting the modules and workload needed to run a decentralized service among several sidechains, devising a block summary and pruning technique, and building mechanisms to handle cross-sidechain operations, syncing the mainchain, and handling interruptions. Third, formulating a security notion for resource markets and sidechains to capture various dependency relationships with the mainchain, and formally proving the security of chainBoost and chainScale based on this notion.

This combined approach should improve the accuracy of data retrieval by non-IT, healthcare, users across a secure, peer-to-peer data platform where data owners retain full ownership and control of their data. The proposed research will also validate through performance testing new blockchain search capabilies will meet the responsiveness and scale required by healthcare enterprises, a key need for commercialization.

Its development today is bound up with political and moral desires and far-reaching claims that the technology has the capacity to challenge or even replace the existing financial system and its centralized institutions with decentralized organizations and governance. In the long wake of the 2008/09 financial crisis, blockchain's promise of decentralization has resonated. But if the vision of decentralization is initially based on the distributed networks architecture of computer systems, what happens when people try to translate it into social reality? What cultural, economic and political concepts and sensibilities underpin the making of blockchain, and how does the technology's development in turn influence human behavior? This project investigates the human dimensions of an opaque yet increasingly widespread technology, formulating both academic and non-academic descriptions and arguments about blockchain's sociocultural and political-economic contours for scholars and broader publics. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in developing more effective methods for communicating science and the scientific method to the public.<br/><br/>The research will consist of fourteen months of ethnographic study in two established blockchain hubs, which are also home to lively crypto-communities. The two research locations allow for comparative tracking of how distinct political, economic, social, and cultural situations and discourses bear on blockchain development. Asking how a digital native or Internet-based infrastructure becomes meaningful across highly uneven economic, geopolitical, and cultural-linguistic contexts, the project also examines how blockchain gains traction in relation to or even at the expense of other matters of concern. In both locations, research will investigate how blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders (1) define value, and how they understand blockchain as a technology that identifies, makes or manipulates value; (2) what attracts them to blockchain; (3) how they think blockchain will and/or should change human relations; and (4) how they imagine decentralization in relation to blockchain's promise. Through data gathered at blockchain-oriented promotional, educational, and networking events, conferences, and hackathons, from online, social and journalistic media, and through interviews with engineers, entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders, the investigation will produce results shedding light on the nature of blockchain as a technology of value and its promise of economic and social decentralization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their key capability is the creation of trustworthy transaction environments: They can execute arbitrarily complex agreements in a manner that is fair to all parties. Smart contracts promise to have a transformative societal impact, bringing radical new efficiency to sectors as diverse as finance, digital media, and insurance. An impediment to the successful deployment of smart contracts, however, is their heightened susceptibility to bugs, which can lead directly to violation of contractual obligations and even theft of assets. Thus, new ways of ensuring the trustworthiness of smart contracts are needed.<br/> <br/>This research project attacks the problem of trustworthiness in smart contracts from two sides. It explores new, proactive, language-based mechanisms for increasing the assurance that contracts are correctly implemented before deployment. Not all errors can be caught prior to deployment, however, so the project also investigates reactive mechanisms for preventing and mitigating the damage caused by incorrectly programmed smart contracts. The reactive methods explored in this research include the principled use of bug bounties to incentivize discovery and reporting of bugs, coupled with built-in mitigation mechanisms that alter contract behavior when bugs are uncovered. The outcomes of this research will include new scientific foundations for smart contract assurance that are applicable to the broader problem of software assurance, as well as practical methods that combine proactive and reactive tools to achieve heightened trustworthiness in deployed smart contracts."

A blockchain is a massively distributed, append-only log of transactions that is cryptographically protected from tampering. Thanks to their capacity towards facilitating fast and inexpensive transactions across the globe and their powerful scripting-language support for complex financial instruments, blockchains have already proven to be a highly disruptive force in the finance and e-commerce sectors. Nevertheless, at least two major hurdles still stand in the way of mainstream blockchain acceptance: 1) 'traditional' blockchain architectures are not sufficiently scalable to handle the ever-growing base of blockchain users and the resulting proliferation of transactions, and 2) despite myriad efforts to improve blockchain privacy, users of public blockchains remain susceptible to devastating attacks on the privacy of their accounts and transactions, which often lead to security breaches causing financial losses for the victims. The approaches explored in this project provide privacy for blockchain users where previous efforts have failed by rethinking the one-size-fits-all approach of using Tor to solve all problems requiring anonymity and/or unlinkability. Indeed, running complex protocols over Tor is fraught with risks and can open users to subtle-yet-devastating deanonymization attacks; the tailor-made solutions developed in this project leverage domain-specific knowledge to mitigate these risks.<br/><br/>The project addresses privacy concerns as they relate both to traditional blockchain transactions and to newer 'payment channel network' transactions. Payment channel networks promise greatly improved scalability by allowing secure (off-chain) payment requiring no interaction with the blockchain ledger. In the context of traditional blockchain transactions, this research develops innovative ways to 1) privately publish transactions to a blockchain by integrating tailor-made anonymous communication protocols directly into the blockchain communication infrastructure, and 2) privately retrieve transactions from a blockchain using carefully optimized private information retrieval (PIR) protocols that support expressive blockchain queries. In the context of payment channel networks, the project 1) explores the (im)possibility of performing off-chain transactions privately, and 2) develops a new theoretical framework and toolkit of algorithms for ensuring availability and quality of service for payment channel transactions in extreme adversarial conditions. Additionally, as part of this project, the multi-institution and transnational team of PIs are deploying a distributed instantiation of the new private blockchain transaction retrieval solutions, which will be open to use by the public.

One central challenge can be expressed as follows: Given specific analysis tasks and specific constraints on the available Big Data, how do we enable productive, efficient, and secure end-to-end value extraction from the data? To address this challenge, we propose to join industry members with participating academic centers in a new site of the existing Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR) I/UCRC, at NC State University (NCSU) in Raleigh, NC, with the goal of conducting trans-disciplinary translational science and research of enabling better decision making in presence of Big Data. The fundamental research done at CHMPR/NCSU will be translated into technology developments, delivering practical solutions to hard problems. This translation will apply to federal agencies, government organizations, and industry sectors struggling with hard Big-Data problems, thus contributing to the progress of science and advancing the future Big-Data needs of the industry and society. <br/><br/>Success in solving the problem of extracting value from massive data hinges on balancing fundamental research, technological know-how, and commercial market intelligence. We propose both to address recognized aspects of this problem and to develop the science and training that will address future aspects of this problem. The CHMPR/NCSU effort toward end-to-end enablement of data will focus on developing technologies and tools for bridging the time gap between the acquisition of data and real-time and long-term decision making. CHMPR/NCSU research projects will be addressing the issue of what are appropriate technologies for: storing and cleaning the data; modeling the data; making the data secure; asking the right analysis questions; pre- and post-processing the data with regard to the analysis; and, finally, making the analysis results useful. The resulting techniques will be applicable across multiple industry sectors, including national security, health care, manufacturing, energy, and business intelligence. The research being done at NCSU will contribute to the computationally intensive analytics-research program of CHMPR, while complementing its portfolio by the NCSU big-data transformation and analysis expertise. The technologies and tools resulting from the proposed work will change the results that can be obtained from the data, as opposed to just obtaining the results faster. The ultimate success of this paradigm shift by the Big-Data-analysis industry will rest on the ability of universities such as NCSU to prepare experts in taking advantage of the data-enablement science and technologies to solve a variety of real-life applications."

This project addresses such requirement by designing and developing a network architecture to securely share data among groups of scientists. A community of scientists sharing a common interest and supporting resources is called a mission. This project will design and prototype the architecture of the Assured Mission Delivery Network (AMDN), which will enable collaboration among scientific communities involving multiple independent organizations with varying levels of trust.  <br/><br/>They novelty of AMDN lies in the notion of network-level Mission Assurance Services (MAS); these services allows mission directors to specify actions to be taken by the network to deal with attacks and anomalies and to quickly reconfigure the network to best assure the successful completion of the mission. Security is the key part of the AMDN design, and addresses essential functionality such as authentication, integrity, accountability and privacy. AMDN also includes Collective Anomaly Detection, in which intra- and inter-cloud networking alarms and anomalies indicative of attacks are combined and used for mission assurance strategies. The detected anomalies and alarms are correlated over the whole system in order to detect sophisticated attacks that might be undetectable at the single node level. The security of the entire system is flexible and programmable depending on the nature of collaborations, computing resources needed, and various requirements of scientists. In addition to scientific use, AMDN can be used for commercial applications such as financial data sharing among banks or health data sharing among hospitals and between critical infrastructures such as Smart Grids.

The project will develop techniques where a monitor observes a running system of blockchains to detect and react to changing conditions that might threaten the protocol's integrity and safety.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three important cross-chain protocols: atomic swaps, off-chain recurring swaps, and atomic transactions. These protocols require the underlying network to display certain critical properties, and runtime verification is expected to play a prime role in monitoring  their health. The project will investigate (1) how algorithms  and techniques adapted from distributed runtime verification can make  cross-chain protocols robust and effective, and (2) how runtime verification  algorithms can be augmented with classic results from distributed computing to develop low-bandwidth distributed monitoring systems appropriate for blockchain applications and beyond.<br/><br/>Society will benefit through more secure and trustworthy software and electronic commerce. As modern society becomes increasingly reliant on software systems for commerce and governance, it becomes increasingly vulnerable to disruption from security breaches. More trustworthy software will provide economic benefits through faster, cheaper, and simpler electronic commerce, cheaper and more effective regulatory compliance, and more transparent and accessible public records. Trustworthy software will enhance individual privacy, making sensitive data accessible only to authorized parties. Truly trustworthy software requires making formal methods a core aspect of distributed system design, not an afterthought.<br/><br/>Data generated as part of this project, including software artifacts, papers and reports, logs generated by experimentation, programming projects, lecture materials, and the project website, will be managed using existing IT and data-protection infrastructures provided by the participating institutions Brown University and Iowa State University.

For example, the financial industry is now experimenting with blockchains and smart contract protocols to improve efficiency and combat fraud in digital asset markets. However, state-of-the-art systems require increasingly complex designs to meet performance and security requirements. For example, they incorporate parallel or partitioned architectures for better performance, as well as cryptographic techniques like zero knowledge proofs to mitigate privacy risks. Furthermore, some of the most successful distributed systems are platforms that can be extended by non-expert application developers writing customized ?smart contract? programs. All of these complicate the task of defining security, let alone proving it, and as a result most distributed systems are still deployed without any rigorous security model at all. This project will address the above challenges by designing new programming language abstractions for defining and analyzing the security of distributed protocols.<br/> <br/>This project is organized along two research directions. The first goal is to bridge the field of programming language design and the widely-used Universal Composability (UC) theory from cryptography. UC a popular standard because of its modularity and strong guarantees, and is widely used for on-paper analysis of blockchain protocols; integrating this into a programming framework will enable application developers to benefit from this modular design approach. The second research thrust aims to explore a new distributed system architecture, called ?robust sharded MPC,"" aimed at providing better scalability and security than existing designs. Combining robust multiparty computation (MPC) together with zero knowledge proofs (ZKP) will be able to overcome the expressiveness limitations of the current state-of-the-art, where ZKP is used alone. By bridging distributed systems and applied cryptography, the approach is unique in using robust sharded MPC to overcome limitations of the state-of-the-art based on zero knowledge proofs alone.  The project will release open source software and to help validate the security of blockchain protocols deployed or in development today, and to support courses and curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is because certain restrictions on data usage (e.g., maintaining appropriate audit logs for the data modifications) must be enforced rigorously, which is difficult to accomplish with existing technologies in a seamless manner.  The need to share scientific data while honoring usage restrictions, protecting data integrity, and capturing provenance for scientific repeatability requires development of new software tools that can support these capabilities across multiple organizations? boundaries. The novel blockchain based data sharing system built as a part of this project may result in advancing the knowledge base on how to automatically balance the conflicting goals of security and integrity requirements and information sharing in the context of open scientific discovery process. This system in return can significantly increase volume and variety of data shared for research purposes across a broad range of disciplines, thereby directly addressing the NSF Big Idea on Harnessing the Data Revolution, by further advancing capabilities of modern cyberinfrastructure and fostering novel opportunities for interdisciplinary data-intensive research. Furthermore, by actively incorporating our research results into the curriculum development, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, we foster the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists in a new era for open data.<br/><br/>To achieve the above stated goals, this project builds an innovative system where blockchain techniques are leveraged for assured scientific data sharing. First, the project develops a policy specification framework tailored for open science data sharing. Using this framework, scientists may easily specify any usage restriction (e.g., do not  re-identify  human  subjects,  do  not  modify  data,  notify  us  if  the  data  is  lost due  to  hacking).  Later on, using the blockchain framework, these restrictions will be captured,  and stored via smart contracts.  One novel aspect of the proposed framework is that, using machine learning techniques, it can analyze the smart contract based provenance information to automatically detect potentially anomalous data modifications. To test the capabilities of our framework,  the project uses a multi-sensor based data collection and data sharing project for understanding the impact of urban pollution as a case study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first focuses on establishing cryptographic security models that expand on classical cryptographic models to adequately reflect malicious subversion attacks: in general, these models call for the design of cryptographic tools to be explicitly coupled with specification of black-box testing procedures so that the combination can guarantee security despite subversion attacks. The second effort pursues development of fundamental cryptographic primitives that achieve security in these new models and application of these primitives as building blocks to construct larger systems and protocols that retain security despite subversion. Finally, to transition these theoretical tools to practice, the project undertakes a practical effort to re-architect existing infrastructural tools, such as the IPSec, SSH and TLS protocols, to harden them against subversion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the movement and availability of water locally and across the country is of paramount importance to economic productivity and human health of our nation. Hydrologic scientists, are actively tackling these challenges using increasingly complex computational methods. However, modeling advances have not been easily translated to the broader community of scientists and professionals due to technical barriers to entry. This software platform draws from computer models and employs supercomputers capable of analyzing big data to provide unprecedented simulations of water movement over the continental US. Combining hydrologists and computer scientists the team behind the project envision a broad community of users who will have multiple ways to interact with the software framework. For the hydrologic scientist who is interested in generating their own scenarios the framework will facilitate direct interaction with the hydrologic models and the ability to generate simulations on the fly. Conversely, the framework will also provide a set of static output and a range of tools for a broader set of users who would like to evaluate hydrologic projections locally or extract model data for use in other analyses.<br/><br/>Continental scale simulation of water flow through rivers, streams and groundwater is an identified grand challenge in hydrology. Decades of model development, combined with advances in solver technology and software engineering have enabled large-scale, high-resolution simulations of the hydrologic cycle over the US, yet substantial technical and communication challenges remain. With support from this award, an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and hydrologists is developing a framework to leverage advances in computer science transforming simulation and data-driven discovery in the Hydrologic Sciences and beyond. This project is advancing the science behind these national scale hydrologic models, accelerating their capabilities and building novel interfaces for user interaction. The framework brings computational and domain science (hydrology) communities together to move more quickly from tools (models, big data, high-performance computing) to discoveries. It facilitates decadal, national scale simulations, which are an unprecedented resource for both the hydrologic community and the much broader community of people working in water dependent systems (e.g., biological system, energy and food production). These simulations will enable the community to address scientific questions about water availability and dynamics from the watershed to the national scale. Additionally, this framework is designed to facilitate multiple modes of interaction and engage a broad spectrum of users outside the hydrologic community. We will provide easy-to-access pre-processed datasets that can be visualized and plotted using built-in tools that will require no computer science or hydrology background. Recognizing that most hydrology training does not generally include High Performance Computing and data analytics or software engineering, this framework will provide a gateway for computationally enhanced hydrologic discovery. Additionally, for educators we will develop packaged videos and educational modules on different hydrologic systems geared towards K-12 classrooms.<br/><br/>This award by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the Cross-Cutting Activities Program of the Division of Earth Sciences within the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A number of research results point the way toward methods that could greatly improve the security of password systems. There is thus both an urgent need and a clear opportunity to transform the general state of industry practice in password management. Toward this end, the researchers build an easy-to-deploy password-protection system called PASS. PASS incorporates recent research on state-of-the-art methods to protect passwords and related user credentials into new innovations. PASS aims to make available to even the smallest organizations a complete, principled, server-side password protection system that offers far stronger security by default than any known existing system.<br/> <br/>PASS transitions later stage research into practice and develops novel extensions to several of the PIs' recent research innovations, including: (1) Pythia, a service for password hardening. Password hardening is technique that applies a cryptographic transform to stored and user-submitted passwords to render them hard to crack. Pythia incorporates a novel and practical such cryptographic transformation, known as a verifiable partially-oblivious pseudorandom function. This transform not only hardens passwords, but also protects against compromise of the service that applies the cryptographic transform and makes it easy to update stored password data, thereby minimizing the impact of a breach. (2) Honey objects: A well established method for mitigating the damage caused by a breach is to incorporate fake or decoy data or services into a system. These objects, often called 'honey objects', serve to divert or deceive an adversary. PASS will incorporate honey objects such as fake user and administrative accounts, doing so in a way that builds on the PIs' recent research into principled use of such objects. (3) Typo-tolerance: In support of an emerging industry practice that enhances usability for clients, PASS will support the optional acceptance of passwords with certain common typographical errors. PASS will enable deployers to avoid current ad hoc methods for such typo-tolerance and instead leverage recent and ongoing research results to achieve a principled security / usability tradeoff. By offering these novel tools in a mature, modular development ecosystem for engineers and researchers, PASS serves not only as a platform to democratize advances in password-protection technologies but also as a stimulus and proving ground for new, practice-oriented research in the security community."

Current blockchain participants have opened their identities and transactions for the world to see even though they risk the dangers that come with that transparency. Even participants that have not disclosed their wallet identities have found their true identities to have been compromised and have faced threats. When an owner conducts a large cryptocurrency transaction, the risk of damage due to exposure can be high whether it be for individuals or businesses.

Two key concerns are that errors in healthcare claims result in frequent payment denials, and failure to obtain prior authorization can make those services non-reimbursable. These issues can lead to inappropriate direct billing to patients and/or a write-off by the healthcare provider and cost-shifting to cover losses. In addition, complexity within the rules for payment and prior authorization require considerable administrative overhead for claim submission, reconciliation, and rework, inflating administrative costs.

The research will conduct advanced claims parsing, data extraction, modeling, and machine learning to define specific patterns of risk, and build reproducible, efficient, and accurate predictive algorithms. These approaches will be applied to both claim denials and to clinical data predictive of prior authorization.

Expected outcomes of this project also include decreased attrition, increased research participation, and higher graduation rates of students who participate as peer-leaders, compared to other psychology majors. Finally, consistent with peer learning implementation in other STEM-focused courses, the most pronounced improvements are expected to be among Black and Hispanic students.

Planning grants are not required as part of the full ERC competition, but intended to build capacity among teams to plan for convergent, center-scale engineering research.<br/><br/>Public infrastructure investment in the US is woefully inadequate, not only to maintain existing demands, but more importantly to meet the needs of an increasingly data-driven economy. The transition to a data-driven economy depends on so-called ?smart cities? which monitor information on city utilities and operations and can respond to changing situations.  Smart infrastructure systems are in an early development stage with rapidly developing applications across water, energy, transportation and buildings. Increasingly, the data analysis skills needed for engineering smart cities, are the same skills needed for many financial models and transactions. Evidence suggests that the very data smart cities collect can lead to new financing models that help fund their development.  The planning grant team will bring together experts in these areas, as well as policy and law.  The goal is to integrate engineering design and financial models in a decision framework that seeks to overcome technical and legal barriers for deployment of intelligent infrastructures.  The societal benefits of this transition include identifying new financial instruments and resources that impacts GDP and jobs, and improves quality of life. Collaboration with public policy experts will explore how smart infrastructures can provide equitable access across rich and poor communities.  Engagement with law school colleagues will address privacy and security concerns, and the impact of data monetization on the financial system. New educational programs such as a Masters in Engineering in Smart Infrastructure Finance will be aimed at training new engineers in the era of artificial intelligence. Training will help engineers engage with business and key civic stakeholders. The described interactions between these disciplines will result in new technologies that stimulate a vibrant innovation ecosystem and facilitate access and use of these technologies. <br/><br/>The planning grant team will explore how sensor-enabled (smart) data networks provide intelligence for the design of efficient financing mechanisms to build and operationalize smart (adaptive, resilient) infrastructure systems. The planning grant activities, including two workshops, will allow the team to engage with potential academic, business and government partners. Despite the excitement, the scalability of smart city infrastructure is hampered by limited operational benchmarking, lack of robust economic models for valuation of information, and pricing mechanisms that may attract public or private investment. The research tests the hypothesis that intelligent infrastructures generate data of sufficient scope, scale, frequency and accuracy that can be aligned with, and tested against, financial models and specifications of emerging data markets.  Through these planning workshops, the proposed Center research activities and strategies to collaborate with industry, investors and the public will be further defined. The objective is to understand how physical or operational performance measurements of smart systems not only enable performance optimization or design iterations, but bring derivative value that can be used or traded in data exchanges.  How can intelligent infrastructures be safely designed - and the IoT data tested - against financial or auction models for value optimization?  Data-driven efficient capital such as insurance and derivatives (futures, options), as well as variable rate performance bonds and smart contracts, increasingly depend on real-time IoT (Internet of Things) information.  In cooperation with industry and public partners, the ERC planning grant team will develop, test and validate engineering models, econometric and financial theory principles using sensor and financial data models in a simulation environmental, and well as based on deployed pilot smart infrastructure systems.  These include smart city components such as: (storm)water utilities, intelligent transportation (roads and bridges), energy systems, and green buildings. The proposed ERC envisions structuring three trust areas reflecting complementary disciplines: (i) Risk quantification and dynamic characterization of infrastructure system data; (ii) Financial risk modeling, pricing, and information valuation in privacy- and cyber security-constrained data markets; (iii) Decision feedback models for infrastructure design, resilience management, and new investment paradigms.  The integration of engineering design with information valuation and pricing, and policy is an emerging field of inquiry and practice with implications for future designs of smart infrastructures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key problem is that decentralized applications are executed by mutually distrusting entities in a decentralized distributed system (such as a blockchain), where the entities must collaborate to execute the desired computation, despite not trusting each other.  Building decentralized applications is difficult and error prone because the low-level security mechanisms are too removed from the high-level policies, thus it is difficult for programmers to correctly implement the policies. In these cases, no single entity is trusted to fully specify or enforce security policies. The project will develop Flame, a programming language offering more precise abstractions for expressing security intent in decentralized systems. Using Flame gives developers assurance that their programs are both secure and realizable without requiring them to design and implement complex security protocols.  This project will also develop Decent, a decentralized runtime platform for executing decentralized applications built with Flame. The project will open-source Flame and Decent and promote them with publications, tutorials, and course materials. <br/><br/>To explore a new, integrated approach to enforce end-to-end security for decentralized applications the project will build a prototype based on techniques for decentralized information flow control, blockchain networks, trusted computing, and cryptography to create a high-level programming layer that eases the task of building, verifying, and deploying decentralized applications.

Increasingly as an enterprise turns to APIs to stitch these diverse network elements together, API security is a critical element of any enterprise?s cybersecurity strategy.  The company?s proposed API security platform leverages a private and permissioned distributed ledger network (DLN) at the heart of its product.  In fact, this DLN enables provision of the first implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for APIs.  To meet the scale and latency requirements of API authentication in real-time without sacrificing security guarantees, the proposed DLN must be highly performant and efficient in both storage and processing.  This SBIR-funded research seeks to advance DLN technology but is also more broadly applicable to the advancement of enterprise applications of distributed ledgers that would benefit from pruning, flexible scaling and orchestration, and heightened performance.<br/> <br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance this foundational blockchain framework by discovering and evaluating approaches to elevate performance of the DLN in the scope of authentication application.   The project will measure and compare the effectiveness of potential advancements to the DLN platform, including: 1) Horizontal scaling of the blockchain network, i.e. varying the number of peers or other components in the network, 2). Pruning of the blockchain to only keep relevant and necessary portions of ledger data, i.e. leading to a more efficient ledger access without sacrificing deep verification.  The research work will extend modeling and simulation infrastructure to pattern and measure real-world, at-scale scenarios.  The research proposed here will have a broad impact to DLT research and serve as a blueprint for production-grade ledger-based technologies to help enable use-cases where the barrier to entry is cost, performance, and/or scalability. The company will utilize these research findings to develop a production-grade model for a performant, scalable DLT-based security product that can meet scenarios as expansive as high-performance cloud computing, and as granular as embedded, industrial control systems and sensor networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Web archiving often runs into two opinions: (1) who cares about the past?  and (2) hasn't the Internet Archive solved this already?  While the Internet Archive is the cornerstone of web archiving, there remains much work to be done to align archiving with the larger web community.  The PIs will investigate a collection of methods and concepts to accelerate the adoption and utility of web archives.  While there are more than a dozen publicly available web archives (including the Internet Archive) that are simultaneously accessible via the Memento protocol, these archives are mostly underutilized because they lack the APIs and services to be of greater immediate use to the live web.  For example, rather than returning ""HTTP 404"" responses for pages that are not archived, the archives can introspect on their collections for replacement or similar pages.  This project will research: (1) extended APIs for archives; (2) models and methods for archival quality; and (3) user tools and techniques for exploring and understanding temporality on the web.  The broader impacts of this research will include increasing the ability of archives to record today's social discourse, which primarily occurs on the web, oftentimes with print or TV as secondary. The ability to publish data on the web far outstrips the ability to archive it for posterity. There are a number of public web archives that are doing yeoman's work saving as much material as they can, but saving is only a precondition for later use. Mostly these archived web pages are being underutilized, only because the tools for extracting the value from these archives are lacking. This project will research and build the tools, infrastructure, and methods to better utilize, understand, and interact with the archived materials that we already have.<br/><br/>Aside from their crawling, archives are mostly passive collections of content that offer little in the way of services other than answering ""yes"" or ""no"" to a request for an archived page. Even with the increased rate of archiving (and a greater number of active web archives), there is little analysis on the web archives to provide better services for incoming requests.  The PIs will build on their prior API work to explore recommendation services for web pages, where even if an archive does not have the requested web page it can make recommendations for a replacement page based on content and link analysis.  This will prevent the web archives from being a dead end if they do not have the requested page.  The PIs will also perform fundamental research on the issue of the quality of the reconstructed page, a topic that has been mostly ignored. In particular the PIs are concerned with detecting and resolving ""temporal violations,"" combinations of HTML pages with embedded resources that are presented to the user as an historical page but in fact they never existed in that combination on the live web. This occurs in at least 5% of the pages replayed through the Internet Archive. The other aspect of quality research deals with automatically assessing how damaged an archived page is with respect to its missing embedded resources.  Straight percentages (e.g., this page is missing 3 of 57 embedded resources) do not tell the whole tale, but there are automated methods that can be used to estimate how important the resource was (even though you do not have it) to the rendered page. This will allow large-scale assessment not only of pages, but of archive-wide performance for comparable time periods. Lastly, the PIs will focus on tools and methods for allowing users to better understand and interact with the archived web and temporal concepts in general.  Users' understanding of temporal concepts is not well advanced, in part because the tools are not in place to allow them to better understand and build models for interaction.

Distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain have recently been applied to provide unforgeable digital records and to improve the trust of the global supply chains. Despite the improved trust in cyberspace, duplication attacks in the physical world are still possible, making counterfeits remain a serious concern, especially for products of high value. Commonly used QR codes or low-cost RFID tags do not prevent counterfeiters from linking fake goods to the distributed-ledger-based supply chain in cyberspace, which compromises the trust of the overall supply chain.  To address this vulnerability, we propose establishing a secure cyber-physical link using physically unclonable features (PUFs) of an item?s surface at the microscopic scale. These microscopic features constitute a ?fingerprint,? which can uniquely characterize and identify the specific item being protected and can be captured by consumer-grade cameras. This research project focuses on microsurface sensing and vision-based authentication and offers a novel solution to complement the existing blockchain-based countermeasures in supply chain management. This non-forgeable cyber-physical link provides proactive authentication by supply chain participants/end-users.  Successful research in this area can mitigate the illicit reuse of old electronic components and prevent counterfeit medicines from reaching patients.<br/><br/>The proposed research effort aims at investigating the scientific foundation and overcoming technological barriers that utilize surface PUFs for linking the physical world to supply chains securely and uniquely via ubiquitous mobile imaging. First, surface PUFs in mobile imaging settings are examined to uniquely identify objects, with a focus on designing efficient and scalable computer vision algorithms. Second, microscopic-level light reflection models are established via physics-guided signal analysis and machine learning approaches to extract surface PUF signals. Third, the integration of the surface PUF verification with the blockchain-based supply-chain information management system is explored and multiscale data collections are planned. The proposed research is expected to advance the scientific understanding of photometric behaviors of microstructures and result in more accurate light reflection models at the microscopic scale via both controlled experiments and machine learning. The information-theoretic modeling of the PUF?s inherent randomness and channel randomness due to processing steps can potentially help identify the bottleneck of the verification system and improve its performance. The proposed ambient light decomposition and estimation scheme facilitate a capability leaping of computer vision for authenticating scenes at the microscopic scale. The proposed research program has the potential to protect public health and national security via safeguarding supply chains. The ubiquity of mobile devices multiplies the economic and societal impacts of our research. The proposed program also seamlessly integrates research, education, and outreach. It will prepare the future security-aware workforce by fascinating them with cutting-edge research results via lectures, projects, and global competitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current practices in handling data incompatibility and quality issues are manual and time-consuming. In addition, these practices are customized for individual projects, a process hard to adapt to different projects. Moreover, the sewer inspection data remains fragmented within the utilities due to the lack of proper data management solutions, which makes data less accessible for asset management. The envisioned technology will help to combine sewer inspection data with standard PACP (Pipeline Assessment Certification Program) format, ensure data quality, and integrate historical data for easy and secured access so that cost-effective asset management plans can be developed based on true conditions. Each utility could save up to 80% of the time (on the order of months) for manual data quality assurance. With accurate and accessible sewer condition data, it is anticipated that at least 20% (approximately $600 million) of the annual spending on pipe rehabilitation can be saved for the entire industry. More importantly, improved sewer infrastructure condition can greatly reduce gastrointestinal (GI) illness emergency room visits induced by sanitary sewer overflow events. <br/><br/>The proposed project is to 1) develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled algorithm to resolve data incompatibility issues to maintain data fidelity and facilitate data exchange among different software platforms; 2) establish a holistic AI-enabled methodological framework to automatically detect and treat data quality issues, including data records inconsistency, incompleteness, and duplicates, caused by the interruption of inspection operations due to pipe defects or human errors; and 3) standardize municipal utilities? practices in managing sewer condition data using blockchain-enabled technologies. This PFI-TT project will tailor the emerging AI/machine learning and blockchain technologies to develop an efficient data format translation algorithm, effective data quality assurance framework, and a blockchain-enabled sewer data management tool, with the objective to save engineers? effort in data processing and render them more time for engineering decision making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the vulnerability of the AI/ML lifecycle becomes increasingly apparent, organizations that rely on the consistency and integrity of their AI/ML are faced with the difficult task of assuring AI/ML security.  Along with challenges involved with tailoring the concept of zero trust into such environments, assuring security also needs to be accomplished quickly. The cost to develop and implement a single AI/ML model can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the malicious alteration of AI/ML models, model features, and training data that effectively poison AI/ML can negate the return on this substantial investment. Such poisoning attacks are a nascent threat that is expected to become widespread as malicious actors gain technical ability. This susceptibility of AI/ML to poisoning attacks poses a severe national security concern as AI/ML has become central to mission-critical defense and intelligence capacities.  <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a lifecycle management tool utilizing blockchain technology. The proposed innovation will enable users to store, train, and deploy data, AI/ML models, and model features, with each transaction or attempted transaction.  These transactions will be immutably logged to provide an audit trail, ensuring that nothing stored on the blockchain can be surreptitiously altered. These project goals are to determine how the use of blockchain technology may enhance the security of the AI/ML lifecycle.  The technology may be used to analyze the AI/ML lifecycle security concerns and foci of stakeholders including intelligence agencies, academia, commercial businesses, and machine learning engineers.  The project will also help determine if practical solutions exist for engineers to secure the machine learning lifecycle, examine economic models that inform the tradeoff of security, cost efficiency, awareness of virtual structure as it relates to the concept of ?Zero AI Trust?, and test usability in machine learning lifecycle management tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although it is well known that poorly-designed interfaces can lead to increased defect rates and software vulnerabilities, there is currently little specific guidance to designers on what precise language and library features make programmers more or less likely to write vulnerable code. Furthermore, little of the existing guidance is empirically based. The project will develop empirically-based guidance on two issues. First, the ISO/IEC standardization working group for the C programming language is currently evaluating multiple proposals for adding concurrency to the language, and this project will produce data to inform their decision-making process. Second, by evaluating the impact of the use of mutability, the project will provide data that may influence how future programming languages and libraries are designed. <br/><br/>The project involves three parts. The first phase is an analysis of flaws in code that uses the draft versions of the C concurrency APIs under consideration as well as comparable Java databases on concurrency-related flaws. In the second and third phases, programmers who have between 2 and 5 years of experience will be asked to complete tasks using competing interface designs. The first set of experiments will evaluate competing C and C++ parallel language extensions to determine which language and library features are more likely to result in secure code. Specifically, the investigators will measure the programmers' ability to produce concurrent code free from security-related defects, such as ""data races"" and ""time-of-check-to-time-of-use"" errors using the different libraries. The investigators will then build upon this work to evaluate tradeoffs between security and usability when using immutability to reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities in concurrent code. Through these two experiments, the project will advance the science of cybersecurity by developing a methodology for empirically evaluating how library and language design affect the frequency with which trained professional programmers inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities during implementation."

The project seeks to develop an autonomic security management framework and apply the framework to realize a self-protecting Healthcare Information System (HIS). The comprehensive self-protection system will enable HISs to autonomously assess their potential security risks, initiate prevention mechanisms, detect realtime intrusions and react to cyber attacks, thus maintaining normal performance and enhancing patient data security and privacy. Undergraduate students will gain research experiences and the research will be integrated in a number of cyber security courses.<br/><br/>The research seeks to adopt computing technology to realize a Self-Protecting Healthcare Information System (SPHIS) that can autonomously assess system security risks, initiate prevention mechanisms, detect real-time intrusions and react to cyber attacks with little or no human intervention. Eventually the SPHIS will maintain the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) ecosystem's normal performance and enhance patients' data security and privacy. An Internet of Things cyber security lab and Healthcare Information System cloud testbed will be built to validate the SPHIS autonomous feature and functions using real-world cyber attacks. The research will determine cyber attacks and use time series forecasting methods to initialize early warning modules and send attack alerts based on the variation of power utilization of IoMT devices. Power consumption of IoMT devices thus will be collected offline when the system is under normal and known cyber attack situations. The power data will be used to set up the IoMT ecosystem's normal behavior region by data mining techniques, and help to identify abnormal behaviors and detect cyber attacks using unsupervised learning techniques. The power data of IoMT devices will be collected online when the HIS is compromised by unknown attacks, and the power data will be analyzed by a network of forensics analysis tools. The attack patterns will be added to update the intrusion detection module.  A dynamic intrusion response system will be developed to select the optimal prevention and protection mechanisms for mitigating cyber attacks. The research promises to change the current HIS cyber security state from poorly prepared to well defended against emerging cyber attacks. This research will also contribute to development of the cyber security workforce and enhance security awareness in healthcare organizations."

This project is based on the premise that organizational and institutional factors - known as governance structures in institutional economics - are as important to Internet routing security as technological design. Internet routing involves decentralized decision making among tens of thousands of autonomous network operators. In this environment, an operator's decisions regarding implementation, organization and monitoring of routing policies powerfully affect the adoption and performance of security technologies.<br/><br/>The research bridges a gap between computer science knowledge of routing and social science theories of organization and networked governance. The interdisciplinary method combines data sets from computer science quantifying the number of routing incidents with network analysis techniques and the insights of institutional economics. Quantitative and qualitative methods are used to assess the relationship between routing security incidents and the governance structures among Internet service providers (ISPs) that affect routing. The research also tests whether deployment of new routing security technologies (e.g. Resource Public Key Infrastructure, RPKI) actually affect the quantity and severity of routing incidents. <br/><br/>Understanding correlations between governance structures and routing security is expected to yield important practical insights for network operators and policy makers in cyber-security. By compiling and rendering usable multiple data sources on routing incidents, the project will contribute to the infrastructure of social science research in cybersecurity. The PI will disseminate the data resources and research results to a broad constituency of academics, policy makers, network operators, industry practitioners, and advocacy groups."

This project will focus on how consumers and retailers evaluate different ethical products, and how ""ethical havens"" - production sites favored for their ethical credentials, to the relative exclusion of others - are formed and challenged over time. This research will contribute to public policy debates about ethical market access and outcomes for countries and firms. In other words, how do countries or individual operations gain ethical consumers' and retailers' trust and allegiance? In light of the advocacy of ethical markets as means of economic development and social and environmental regulation by institutions such as the World Bank and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), it is important to provide communities, firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), national governments, and others with insights about how to actively intervene to increase the viability of those projects with the most benefits on the ground or, more fundamentally, whether or not to pursue ethical markets in the first place. The researcher will share the results of this research through summary reports, speaking engagements, and media outreach. She will also convene a workshop on ethical havens to foster comparative work (including a book project) on ethical markets and their spatial outcomes across multiple industries, and will mentor undergraduate and graduate research assistants in qualitative and quantitative data gathering and analysis. <br/><br/>One of the key questions surrounding so-called ethical markets is who benefits? While there is evidence of price premiums and other benefits for producers, there is also evidence of the dilution of ethical standards over time and the exclusion of the most progressive practices and smallest producers. In the case of ethical diamonds, the market has diversified over time, with new African empowerment discourses backing product offerings from a range of countries, and a diversity of retailer trajectories (i.e. some switching away from Canadian diamonds, others sticking with them, and yet others diversifying). The question remains, to what extent have the challenges to Canada's ethical monopoly actually changed the market? Specifically, how much market share have different ethical alternatives, including Canadian diamonds, gained and lost over time; how have their governance structures and marketing strategies changed over time; and, what factors explain these market shifts? This project will combine quantitative and qualitative analysis, including the creation of a database of ethical product offerings and representations (including changes over time), in-depth interviews with retailers and other stakeholders, and consumer surveys. Since consumer and corporate cultures vary geographically, this study will take a comparative approach, focusing on potential national and sub-national differences among major ethical diamond markets (the United States, Canada, and the UK)."

This transition can enable safe and remote work away from hazardous construction sites with the potential to reduce obstacles for women to join the industry while also creating an inclusive work environment. At the same time, it is also important to improve the gender diversity of the construction industry, where women and other minority workers represent less than 10% of the workforce. In light of this, the project will investigate gender differences in collaborating and teleoperating robots, and capitalize on the understandings to develop robot learning and teleoperation methods that are accessible and equitable across genders. A novel blockchain-based mechanism will also be created to assess workers? competence and performance to improve fairness and equity in future construction jobs. This research will also measure the impacts of developed technologies on future construction work, characterizing the intended potential and unintended consequences on workers and organizations. If successful, the developed technology ecosystem will help improve worker productivity, safety, and health, and equip the U.S. workers to lead the way in the construction industry reform in a gender-inclusive manner.

Distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain have recently been applied to provide unforgeable digital records and to improve the trust of the global supply chains. Despite the improved trust in cyberspace, duplication attacks in the physical world are still possible, making counterfeits remain a serious concern, especially for products of high value. Commonly used QR codes or low-cost RFID tags do not prevent counterfeiters from linking fake goods to the distributed-ledger-based supply chain in cyberspace, which compromises the trust of the overall supply chain.  To address this vulnerability, we propose establishing a secure cyber-physical link using physically unclonable features (PUFs) of an item?s surface at the microscopic scale. These microscopic features constitute a ?fingerprint,? which can uniquely characterize and identify the specific item being protected and can be captured by consumer-grade cameras. This research project focuses on microsurface sensing and vision-based authentication and offers a novel solution to complement the existing blockchain-based countermeasures in supply chain management. This non-forgeable cyber-physical link provides proactive authentication by supply chain participants/end-users.  Successful research in this area can mitigate the illicit reuse of old electronic components and prevent counterfeit medicines from reaching patients.<br/><br/>The proposed research effort aims at investigating the scientific foundation and overcoming technological barriers that utilize surface PUFs for linking the physical world to supply chains securely and uniquely via ubiquitous mobile imaging. First, surface PUFs in mobile imaging settings are examined to uniquely identify objects, with a focus on designing efficient and scalable computer vision algorithms. Second, microscopic-level light reflection models are established via physics-guided signal analysis and machine learning approaches to extract surface PUF signals. Third, the integration of the surface PUF verification with the blockchain-based supply-chain information management system is explored and multiscale data collections are planned. The proposed research is expected to advance the scientific understanding of photometric behaviors of microstructures and result in more accurate light reflection models at the microscopic scale via both controlled experiments and machine learning. The information-theoretic modeling of the PUF?s inherent randomness and channel randomness due to processing steps can potentially help identify the bottleneck of the verification system and improve its performance. The proposed ambient light decomposition and estimation scheme facilitate a capability leaping of computer vision for authenticating scenes at the microscopic scale. The proposed research program has the potential to protect public health and national security via safeguarding supply chains. The ubiquity of mobile devices multiplies the economic and societal impacts of our research. The proposed program also seamlessly integrates research, education, and outreach. It will prepare the future security-aware workforce by fascinating them with cutting-edge research results via lectures, projects, and global competitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this environment, overcoming the trust-tax barrier is a significant impediment to market participation for newer or smaller organizations. The SmartChainDB project will investigate the foundations and implementation of middleware for achieving the vision of ""smart digital marketplaces"" where partnerships between service organizations are brokered digitally rather than with physical interactions. It aligns with the NSF Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering Big Ideas vision and can serve to improve US competitiveness in advanced manufacturing. <br/><br/><br/>The vision is to build on the general properties of the present-day technology of trust (blockchains) and develop necessary extensions for enabling (i) declarative descriptions of both service provider capabilities and service requestor needs; (ii) a data-driven trust model based on data and metadata about organizations, their assets, capabilities and performance records; (iii) automatic matching and trust-based validation of service providers' bids to requests for service; and (iv) confidentiality and privacy of sensitive parts of partner transactions and collaborations. Key design challenges will be supporting these goals while achieving scalability, performance, and quality.  The SmartChainDB project will deepen our insights in the area of software systems for digital trust. It will provide inter-disciplinary training opportunities for the next-generation of computer scientists and industrial systems engineers. It also has the potential to broaden market participation in various industries by significantly reducing the trust-tax burden, ensuring a more level playing field for smaller and startup organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed approach will protect home owners from serious IT security threats posed by improperly configured IOT devices in an average household. Cloud computing and storage service providers, as well as regular website owners, discover new ways to mitigate attacks, manage server control commands, and deliver media content. Rapidly developing industries relying on a stable internet connection, such as autonomous vehicles and commercial drones, will have the opportunity to be protected from cyber threats with the proposed solution.  <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover new approaches to cybersecurity matters. In the traditional internet the number of available IPs and ports is rather small, making it easy to scan one's network and see potential vulnerabilities based on responses received. Instead of exposing network devices to everyone on the web 2.0, users will be able to put them behind the system proposed for development, which acts as an additional layer on top of the traditional TCP/IP concept. With the system listening only to the designated 32-byte long dynamically changing IPFS address the chances of guessing the right one is 1/2256, thus making it practically impossible to purposefully find the ?entrance?. During the research and development process the project will work on the physical product realization, modify IPFS nodes, and design protocols responsible for decentralized VPN channels and media content delivery on the web 3.0, because solving latency issues will create new opportunities for the real-time communications on distributed networks. Another goal of this research effort is to mitigate the forthcoming threats imposed by the quantum computers, which will be achieved through the utilization of post-quantum encryption algorithms applicable to data transmitted through the traditional and decentralized mediums.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most existing approaches view a network as a series of snapshots, where a snapshot represents the state of a network in a given time period. Therefore, different network operations need to be individually performed over each snapshot. In reality, online social networks are continuously evolving and therefore, network operations should be automatically performed as networks evolve and need to be done efficiently and reliably. Viewing the problem from this perspective allows us to create a solution that supports advanced, real-world use cases such as tracking the neighborhood of a given node or tracking how network connections evolve in time to determine effective marketing campaigns. These examples indicate the need for efficient computing techniques for important network statistics as the large networks evolve over time. To address this problem, the researchers in this project complement existing distributed evolving social graph analysis techniques with bootstrap and other statistical re-sampling based approaches. The ultimate goal is to develop novel data-driven tools so that when needed, not only certain estimates of statistical network models could be computed efficiently but their estimation errors are reliably quantified. <br/><br/>This project primarily targets development of new efficient and robust methods for anomaly and outlier detection on large sparse networks. The resulting methodology provides the following functions: 1) a computationally efficient finite sample inference for an extensive range of network topology statistics; 2) a flexible data-driven characterization of network structure and dynamics, and 3) comprehensively quantifying uncertainty in modeling and estimation of large networks, without imposing restrictive conditions on network model specification. The expected advances are both in research methods - new approaches to data-driven nonparametric inference for large sparse networks and in substantial enhancement of knowledge of network dynamics and formation in the era of digital communication. The project can significantly benefit students by providing a broad exposure to interdisciplinary applications of large network and fostering awareness of interdisciplinary relationships -- hence enhancing their capacity for critical thinking and opening up new career paths."

As the technology to manipulate images and create fake videos has become more accessible, the public trust of photos and videos as evidence has been eroding. This project combats this problem by creating a process to prove that images are not fake or manipulated. This is achieved by a secure application that can be used to capture images or videos and instantly register a proof of origin (location, time, and metadata) and forensic identification of the data on the blockchain. This process may restore trust in any business transaction which uses photos or videos as evidence.  The commercial value is to both public entities such as in law enforcement and in service businesses required to store images for proof of delivery, inspection, completion of work, etc. Finally, this technology helps online news agencies to enable public verification of news stories, restoring public trust on local digital news platforms.    <br/> <br/>The proposed project builds a system to store proof of origin of data on a blockchain-backed storage system, creating a chain of custody that begins at the time of data creation (such as when a smart phone or camera is used to record a video or take a picture). The process seeks to differentiate between verifiable media and fake media, the latter of which may combat misinformation in online platforms. The intellectual merit is in the development of a novel perceptual hashing algorithm that can achieve 98% precision in detecting tampered images from a mix of original and compressed or enhanced copies; a smart contract that supports confidentiality and integrity of the data and the auditability and accountability of the storage system, while allowing erasure of data to support the Right to be Forgotten.  The technology also develops a novel database auditing process to solve the paradox between openness of a public blockchain and data producer?s right to privacy.

Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to fundamentally improve transportation systems by dramatically reducing crashes, assisting traffic flows, reducing travel time and energy consumption, providing critical mobility to the elderly and disabled, and making vehicle sharing convenient, popular, and necessary. This project studies the architecture and privacy issues related to autonomous vehicle sharing (AVS) that can revolutionize our transportation experience by providing novel time-sharing and ride-sharing services. The time-sharing services allow AVs to be shared by different users at non-overlapping time periods, while the ride-sharing services allow AVs to be shared by users taking similar trips during the same time period. With autonomous driving techniques, the quality of both services can be significantly enhanced to benefit commuters. However, the time- and ride- sharing systems need to communicate with users to organize shared vehicles, which is not risk free. Massive information on users' activities can be exposed in case of privacy breach. Existing privacy-preserving techniques cannot be applied effectively and efficiently in AVS due to problems and requirements unique to AVS, e.g., location- and time- sensitive trips and multi-user coordination. This project addresses the unique privacy problems raised by AVS and proposes effective and efficient privacy-preserving techniques, which can promote AVS among users.<br/><br/>The research in this project will have major technological impacts on privacy-preserving AV sharing services. The project will study the privacy-preserving task matching problem for the time-sharing service and the privacy-preserving trip searching problem for the ride-sharing service, while computation and communication overhead, trip delays due to unexpected conditions, costs of transitional trips, users' social preferences, and different privacy protection levels will be considered. The proposed research activities will trigger further research in other applications such as social networks, vehicular ad hoc networks, smart grid, and electric vehicles communications, where privacy is an important factor. The results from this research will be disseminated through conference and journal publications, online documents, and software release. Seminars to high school and community colleges students will be offered in the Boston and Cookeville areas, and presentations regarding the proposed research will be delivered to demonstrate how science and engineering can enhance quality of life in order to stimulate the students' interest in technology.

Such contracts can implement new, decentralized financial instruments or even virtual corporations defined only by the bundle of smart contracts programmatically governing their behavior.  For example, an eBay-like smart contract could directly connect buyers with sellers, support a variety of auction mechanisms, and manage necessary payments (including escrow), without the transaction charges currently imposed by eBay, PayPal, and the credit card companies.  In general, moving business processes into smart contracts promises to lower costs, reduce friction, and unleash innovation by eliminating intermediaries and automating settlements. However, programming smart contracts requires a deep understanding of cryptographic techniques, a non-standard execution cost model, and economic mechanism design.  Existing smart-contract programming languages provide little support for such reasoning; indeed, contract vulnerabilities (such as TheDAO) have already led to multi-million-dollar thefts.  In contrast, this project will develop new techniques and tools to support the development of high-assurance smart contracts, with an emphasis on the challenges that make such contracts particularly difficult to write correctly.<br/><br/>This project will address the unique challenges of writing high-assurance smart contracts by designing a new high-level language, Solidified, that allows a programmer to express both the intent of the contract and its design constraints (e.g., bounds on resource usage, synchronicity or secrecy requirements, or economic expectations).  We will develop tools to analyze and compile such contracts into executable code. At a high-level, Solidified will support high-assurance smart-contract writing across three dimensions.  First, Solidified will mix automatic and annotation-driven compilation to a diverse set of underlying cryptographic primitives necessary to provide the security smart contracts require.  The compilation process will be integrated with tools for automated resource analysis that will compute tight bounds on the amount of gas a smart contract uses.  Resource analysis, in turn, will enable automated reasoning about higher-level properties, particularly those with an economic flavor.  For example, given a contract, new analysis tools, using probabilistic resource analysis, will determine whether a player's expected payoff is maximized by following the protocol, indicating whether it is incentive compatible.  Extending the analysis across contracts will evaluate whether systemic risks are understood and mitigated.  This project's foundational work in high-assurance smart contracts will help realize the vision of blockchain technology. In addition, smart-contract programming also provides a unique pedagogical opportunity for teaching security. Hence, research results will be incorporated into graduate security courses, a smart-contract security MOOC, and an outreach program for K-12 teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the current IoT ecosystem, IoT service providers have full control of the collected user data. They use the data for smart IoT system and device control. They could also use the data for other purposes not consented to by the users. This project proposes a novel data usage control framework, PrivacyGuard, that aims to empower data owners with full control over how their sensitive data is used so as to protect the data from certain types of privacy breaches. PrivacyGuard ensures that user data can only be used only by user-approved programs and each use of data has a non-repudiable usage record.

There are four key research thrusts in this project. The first thrust focuses on the design of an IoT data protection framework that coexists with the existing architecture at different layers of communication. The second research thrust aims to develop novel techniques to enable the confidential execution of contract function off-chain, by exploiting hardware-assisted TEE and its associated attestation technologies. The third thrust focuses on smart contract designs to effectively embed user-defined privacy policies and trustworthy tracking of data usage using the blockchain.

In FL, the learning of ML models is performed directly on user devices, while the aggregated model is composed with a help of a central server. As data never leave user devices, this new paradigm offers a key promise to protect data privacy. It, unfortunately, poses new challenges in both security and privacy. On one hand, malicious users can compromise security by injecting backdoors into the model updates, thus poisoning the aggregated model. On the other hand, there is a risk of privacy leakage as an untrusted server can inverse the model update to expose private data. This project develops a principled and systematic FL framework that simultaneously offers both privacy and security protection against threats from malicious users and servers. As part of this project, novel protocols will be developed to ensure verifiability, execution integrity, model confidentiality, and protection against adversarial attacks. The success of the project holds significant potential in expanding machine learning to new application scenarios, especially, when no trust is assumed among the stakeholders. The findings may also benefit other fields, such as zero-knowledge proof, distributed machine learning, and distributed ledger technology. The project involves students at all levels, with an emphasis on attracting students from underrepresented groups and K-12 students.<br/><br/>The focus of the project is to develop a principled and systematic FL framework with three jointly key components: 1) a lightweight secure aggregation and backdoor inspection mechanisms in which each user is responsible for both securely aggregating their values and an attestation of an attack-free model, 2) a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) attestation that minimizes non-arithmetic operations to maintain both high accuracy and communication-efficiency, and 3) a blockchain-based FL architecture to tight together security measures at various stages in the training process, offering privacy and security protection for the entire training process. By shifting a task of proving that model is free-of-attack to users, coupling of Blockchain for transparency, this project provides a first step towards a secured and privacy protection of distributed learning systems. The success of this novel approach will significantly impact the design of FL for many real-life applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The consumption of disposable consumer products drives many environmental challenges, including waste and pollution streams with global impact. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption and waste by cycling products and materials back into production. A convergence team of engineers, economists, anthropologists, and environmental assessment experts will work to develop the knowledge needed to achieve circular economies by closing and slowing resource loops. <br/><br/>To address closing resource loops, the research team will examine the technical and scientific challenges of how to formulate, produce, and use material resources to reduce consumption and environmental impact while also creating new ways to sustainably cycle these resources back into use at end-of-life. Plastic products serve as a key case study, with an emphasis on molecularly-designed products for disassembly and reuse. The project includes research on a recyclable thermoset composite system which can be ""uncured,"" separated, and collected for reuse. A general equilibrium behavioral-economic model that incorporates insights from psychology and anthropology and considers non-optimizing, highly-socialized behaviors will be used to consider associated economic, business, and environmental factors. To address slowing resource loops, the researchers will focus on design standardization and new business models to extend product value. They will also explore the integration and development of blockchain for asset and material tracking. The creation of knowledge with stakeholder input will inform innovative technical and science-based advances, engagement approaches, and novel business models. Using Complexity Leadership Theory and network analysis, members of the project will study convergence research in action and design interventions to strengthen connections within the research team.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While a number of cryptographic mechanisms that enhance data privacy exist in the literature, they suffer from prohibitive computational and communication costs and do not offer accountability mechanisms. Without improvements in efficiency and addition of accountability mechanisms, it is unlikely that the so much needed privacy-preserving systems will be massively adopted. Towards the goal of bringing privacy-enhancing technologies closer to adoption, this project defines and constructs a number of new cryptographic building blocks such as new types of digital signatures, cryptographic accumulators and zero-knowledge proofs which are at the core of mechanisms used to enhance privacy. <br/><br/>In order to build practical protocols, the project introduces new security relaxations and security models (such as user-device separation) while adhering to the principles of provable secure protocol design, and designs accountability mechanisms for different system participants without relying on trusted third parties and secret trapdoors. The research is organized under three main thrusts which focus on different application areas. Namely, the project investigates anonymous decentralized payments (blockchain based), anonymous authentication (via the use of anonymous credentials), and auditable multi-party computation (MPC) for specific functions. The performed research includes collaborations with Policy and Economics researchers in order to design meaningful accountability mechanisms and leverage blockchain incentives. The project provides education on fundamentals and practices of cryptography and privacy-preserving techniques to students with various backgrounds: from K-12 students to engineering and CS students, as well as policy students and senior executives studying at the MBA level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, the principle investigators will study equations involving sparse polynomials -- polynomials that have few terms but very high degree.<br/><br/>But solving equations is more than just calculating quickly -- it also means understanding, and using, computational hardness.

This project investigates use of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), of which the famous example is Blockchain, to support automated and secure dynamic allocation mechanisms that enhance spectrum efficiency and availability. The project explores use of DLT for interaction among mutually distrustful Zone Management Systems (ZMS), a general category of automatic spectrum management mechanisms that includes currently deployed Spectrum Access Systems and future derivatives. Multiple ZMS must collaborate even though they do not trust each other, as in current SAS where competing administrators manage a single shared band, or in future radio dynamic zones like a radio telescope observatory where the observatory ZMS trades spectrum back and forth with the ZMS for a neighboring mobile wireless operator. Use of DLT enables a new collaboration approach that reaches agreement faster, delivers more optimal outcomes, is better protected against malicious ZMS, is more auditable by regulators, and enhances data privacy for spectrum users compared to current SAS designs. This project investigates DLT for ZMS collaboration from technical and policy perspectives and seeks to impact future Federal Communications Commission regulations.<br/><br/>Collaboration among multiple SAS today relies on each SAS running the same decision algorithm on the same input data. The new architecture explored in this project assumes each ZMS runs a proprietary decision algorithm on proprietary data ? which increases efficiency while enhancing innovation and flexibility ? and achieves coherent spectrum assignment decisions through a distributed agreement process and an auditable record to prevent cheating. Within the new architecture, this project focuses on policies and enabling technologies for privacy-preserving information exchange and Byzantine-resilient collaboration among participating ZMS. Project work includes: (1) Evaluate multiple DLT technologies such as proof-of-stake systems that are more energy-efficient than Blockchain. (2) Identify essential data that must be exchanged among ZMS. (3) Develop a lightweight (i.e., time bounded), secure, reliable, and trustworthy DLT-based protocol for assignments. (4) Explore an off-chain secure contract execution approach to reduce protocol execution complexity. (5) Apply privacy-enhancing technologies including multiparty computation and trusted execution environments to safeguard the privacy of ZMS proprietary data and algorithms and spectrum users.

Project outcomes will also improve ethics pedagogy for information and computing researchers, with case studies that demonstrate best practices for self-regulation.<br/><br/>To accomplish their goals, the PIs will utilize multiple methods, including citation analysis, content analysis, and interviews, to illuminate and evaluate the ethical culture of computer security research.  The project asks four questions: R1) How has the computer security community formed an ethical research culture? R2) How are ethics expectations communicated among researchers? R3) What sociotechnical factors support and challenge sustaining ethical practices? R4) How effective is ethical self-regulation in computer security research? The research will be conducted in four phases.  Phase I will examine the development of ethics controversies and community responses through an analysis of key ethics moments in the last twenty years of computer security research through citation and discourse analysis.

In a dynamic network, the topology of the network---both nodes (representing processors/endhosts) and communication links---changes continuously over time.  Modern networking technologies such as peer-to-peer networks, overlay networks, and ad hoc wireless and mobile networks, are inherently very dynamic; furthermore, they are resource-constrained, unreliable, and vulnerable to attacks.  Distributed/decentralized algorithms are critical to the  efficient operation of large-scale communication networks, e.g., distributed shortest paths algorithms are used for routing in the Internet.  Till recently, much of the distributed algorithmic theory developed over the last three decades has focused mainly on static networks; as such its results do not apply to  dynamic networks.  This necessitates the development of a solid theoretical foundation for robust, secure, and scalable distributed computing for dynamic networks.  Such a foundation is critical  to realize the full  potential of these large-scale   networks that  have a  wide variety of applications including communication,  data storage and retrieval, environment monitoring, electronic commerce, resource distribution and sharing, and search.<br/><br/>The project will develop a rigorous theoretical foundation for  distributed computing in highly dynamic networks.  In particular, it will develop and analyze  distributed algorithms  that scale well to very large-sized networks, are highly robust to dynamic changes and large-scale failures, and are secure against malicious participants in the network.  The project will result in an algorithmic toolkit which will provide the building blocks for performing distributed computation in dynamic networks, besides providing algorithms with performance guarantees and theoretical benchmarks for practitioners.  The project has  the potential to impact the design and engineering of topologically-aware and self-regulating networks, i.e.,  networks that can measure, monitor, and regulate themselves in a decentralized fashion. The PI plans to develop a new course and a textbook on distributed network algorithms that is closely related to the research undertaken. This research will actively involve postdoctoral researchers, graduate students,  and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The project has two key research goals. First, it will design and analyze scalable and robust distributed algorithms for fundamental distributed computing problems including agreement, leader election, storage and search, and routing. These problems are basic building blocks in distributed computing and are widely used. Motivated by fault-tolerance and security considerations, the project will study the above problems in an adversarial dynamic setting, that can also include the presence of Byzantine (malicious) nodes which may try to foil the distributed algorithm. The project will also study lower bounds on the performance of distributed algorithms including the amount of dynamism that can be tolerated. Second, it will develop fully-distributed algorithms for computing key global metrics of a network and to maintain dynamic networks with desirable properties. This addresses an important issue that is complementary and also critical to the first goal, i.e., how to measure basic parameters of a dynamic network such as its size, connectivity properties, conductance, average degree and other node-related statistics.  A related goal is to construct and maintain dynamic networks with good topological properties such as low diameter, high connectivity, and high conductance. In both the above research goals, the key challenge is to design scalable distributed algorithms that are robust and fault-tolerant even under a high amount of dynamism and the presence of a large amount of Byzantine nodes. The project will build on and significantly extend the distributed algorithmic framework for dynamic networks that was recently developed by the PI and his collaborators."

A secure yet progressively decentralized patient data transfer protocol would heighten transparency of clinical decision-making processes and also increase opportunities for patient engagement during prior authorization of medical prescriptions. Further, since administrative costs increase the cost of benefits, which in turn increases the cost of care access, the potential commercial impact is that payers who lower administrative costs will be better positioned to offer higher reimbursement rates for a greater range of quality treatment options, at increasingly lower cost.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to deliver a distributed ledger with smart contracts specific to the domain of pharmaceutical benefits. Since the cause of processing inefficiency lies with siloed and incomplete patient histories, this protocol resolves administrative inefficiencies through distributed ledger technology supporting fast and compliant encrypted health data sharing among prescribers, payers, and patients. Research objectives include: 1) automating criteria fulfillment to reduce administrative waste; 2) leveraging machine learning to automate simpler case reviews; and 3) designing a shared interorganizational processing protocol capable of adapting to an introduction of revised clinical standards. Smart contracts will be deployed to a distributed ledger infrastructure to formalize and enforce clinical standards as well as contractually specified financial rules and actuarial analyses at an interorganizational level. With smart contracts embedded in the authorization process to automatically curate more robust clinical histories over each prescription lifecycle, available real world data meeting contractually specified quality standards for clinical review will increase. Historical authorization data will feed back into incrementally complex cases, advancing artificial intelligence for authorization decision support. The expected result is improved real-time insight into clinical risk, affording payers the ability to financially and strategically adapt to patient needs with increasing precision and agility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most attractive features of an intelligent B5G network is to share data among objects to collaboratively make comprehensive decisions and provide better services to people. A huge amount of data is produced and collected by Internet of Things (IoT) connected through the BSG edge networks. Breach of integrity, authentication, or privacy of data may cause disastrous consequences as the dependence of the economy and societies on the security of data also deepen. B5G-based IoT applications must meet highly dynamic and diverse requirements in terms of latency, reliability, data rate, and user-defined performance metrics. In addition, most of the data is locally significant, which is generated, collected, processed on-site or near-site for instant decision making. Transmitting these data to a remote cloud center not only causes unnecessary delays but also wastes precious resources. Instead, there is a need for decentralized, online solutions that can proactively adapt to the B5G edge network dynamics.<br/><br/>This project will advance the research frontier of data security in B5G wireless network enabled intelligent edge computing paradigm. Aiming at paving the way to make blockchain an organic part of future intelligent networks, the investigator proposes a novel Federated Ledgers Architecture with fair proof-of-work (PoW) consensus enabled by Miner-twins in the Edge-fog-cloud paradigm (FLAME). Leveraging the Digital Twins (DT) and Microservices architecture, FLAME is a scale-able, decentralized data security solution for highly heterogeneous B5G IoT networks. This project consists of two technical components: (1) a Federated ledgers-based Decentralized Data Management (Fed-DDM) scheme for data assurance in hierarchical edge networks; and (2) a novel edge-fog-cloud Miner-Twins (MinT) architecture to enable a Fair-Mining-as-a-Service (FMaaS) consensus mechanism in heterogeneous blockchain networks at the edge.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, there is a significant barrier impeding wide-spread applicability: PoW is expensive. This project aims to significantly reduce the cost of PoW schemes, and thereby broaden their utility.  Our general model concerns a distributed system consisting of good and bad identifiers (IDs).  The good IDs have two goals: (1) ensure fair sharing of a limited resource; and (2) securely perform distributed computations.  The bad IDs are controlled by an attacker who possesses a constant fraction of the computational resources, and tries to subvert these goals. An important security objective is to develop mechanisms that preserve these goals while incurring bandwidth and computational costs that scale with the magnitude of an attack. That is, when there is no attack, costs are low; conversely, when there is an attack, the good IDs' cost grows commensurately with the attacker's cost.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on the design of distributed algorithms for: (i) tolerating large attacks while having good IDs spend asymptotically less than the attacker; (ii) handling a setting where participants are selfish but rational; and (iii) designing fast and robust diffuse protocols via attack-resistant overlays with low state and bandwidth costs.

The first thrust focuses on the design of an IoT data protection framework that coexists with the existing architecture at different layers of communication. The second research thrust aims to develop novel techniques to enable the confidential execution of contract function off-chain, by exploiting hardware-assisted TEE and its associated attestation technologies.

Interested students can study further by taking two cybersecurity focused courses and cybersecurity capstone projects created by this project. Using all these materials students can create a cybersecurity concentration. Second, the project will use the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) infrastructure in the development of empirical labs and the capstone project assignments.  GENI offers an affordable cloud solution to small institutions that lack the infrastructure to support sophisticated computer labs. The learning impact of the new curriculum will be evaluated by quantitative competency assessments that are administered yearly.  Student cybersecurity persistence will be assessed by a longitudinal study of the number of  cybersecurity courses taken during a student's course of study. Qualitative assessment of the curriculum will take the form of student interviews and focus groups to gauge attitude towards course modules, perception of learning gains and comfort level with the pedagogies employed. In addition to the collaboration of three college level institutions, this project will leverage relationships with local community colleges to further develop a cybersecurity workforce.

As data never leave user devices, this new paradigm offers a key promise to protect data privacy. It, unfortunately, poses new challenges in both security and privacy. On one hand, malicious users can compromise security by injecting backdoors into the model updates, thus poisoning the aggregated model. On the other hand, there is a risk of privacy leakage as an untrusted server can inverse the model update to expose private data.

The burgeoning technology of additive construction, or three-dimensional construction printing (3DCP), might exacerbate the situation. Because concrete (inks) used in 3DCP consists of much more binders (mostly Portland cement) compared to conventional concrete, the increasing adoption of 3DCP is now speeding-up the consumption of cement in the construction sector. The innovation in the 3DCP inks needs to be accelerated to change the situation - greener inks need to be designed, produced, and supplied to the market more quickly. The carbon embodiment and other aspects, including energy consumption, the supply chain efficiency, the broader economic and environmental impacts, are seldom considered holistically in the life cycle design of most general-purpose concrete, not to mention the 3DCP concrete. The uncertainties associated with these aspects make it more challenging. Significant gaps exist between the material science, printer manufacturing, concrete producing, supply networks, governmental legislation and policies, and the 3DCP end users. Therefore, this convergence accelerator project will develop a novel framework, OpenMatFlo, for accelerating the convergence at the concrete industry and 3DCP nexus. The research can have fundamental socioeconomic impact by contributing to the innovation of new materials for the 3DCP industry. While the project context is focused on the 3DCP sector, the new capabilities can be ported to other areas. The project can provide transformational insights, cutting-edge simulation and data accessibility toolkits for the 3DCP community, as well as STEM education and research opportunities for a diverse cohort of students, postdocs, and early-career scientists. The society will benefit from the accelerated adoption of greener 3DCP, in terms of fighting against carbon emission and climate change. The platform will be scalable to the globe and extendable for other industries. <br/><br/>This project will bring together knowledge from mechanics and construction, material research and production, printer manufacturing, life cycle and environment management, uncertainty quantification, computer science and blockchain, disaster science and community resilience, and urban/social science to build a convergent platform for designing, producing, and supplying greener inks for 3DCP towards built environment sustainability. The researchers will employ an open and crowdsourcing paradigm for incentivizing community data-driven material innovation; a market-based strategy will be employed to promote the adoption of life cycle-aware and lower carbon solutions in the concrete and construction industry (with an emphasis on the 3DCP sector); a blockchain technology will be developed to enhance the transparency of the ecosystem under uncertainties; tools will be created for scenario- and performance-based project planning, accounting for socioeconomic benefits of communities under chronic/acute stressors of the natural and built environment. Through rigorous data collection and analysis, the Phase 1 team will identify stakeholders in the nexus of 3DCP and co-design a holistic platform that facilitates its growth in a sustainable way, by data sharing and holistic tracking of carbon emissions and continuous material flow analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current microgrids' combinations of power generation, storage, and consumption that may or may not be integrated with the broader electric grid?mostly depend on a centralized dispatch approach, with one single operator making decisions regarding which assets to utilize and when. Centralized systems require large efforts to set up and do not efficiently adapt to changes in generation or consumption. The proposed technology will employ a different logic for controlling assets, automatically and continuously optimizing the dispatch decisions by using a decentralized blockchain ledger. The benefits of this control system include dramatically increased flexibility when assets are added or removed from the system, and much greater resiliency as there is no single point of failure of the system. Electric utilities will be able to leverage the system to more effectively manage the grid and deploy ""virtual power plants"" rather than depend on inefficient and costly ""peaker"" plants. Overall the technology will accelerate adoption of microgrids, improving the nation's energy infrastructure. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to design the decentralized control logic for microgrids, test it via computer simulations, and conduct a limited physical test at an active site with solar panels, batteries, and other types of energy assets. Current control systems generally utilize a rigid, centralized dispatch logic that does not automatically adapt to changing conditions. A substantial body of research has been conducted demonstrating the benefits of decentralized ledgers in controlling electric grids. The proposed research will put the theoretical foundation into practice by developing the related algorithms to be able to commercialize a microgrid control system. While the benefits of decentralized systems are clear, the complexity is also drastically increased when compared with existing centralized systems. The software must be robust enough to handle the transactions with stability and redundancy, while also simple enough to not strain telecommunications and computing resources within the system.

This preprocessing phase can be problematic since the system loses all security guarantees if the secret trapdoor generated during preprocessing is compromised. To make matters worse, the preprocessing is often not a one-time operation, and must be repeated for each application or, even worse, for different input sizes of the very same application.<br/><br/>The project investigates ways to circumvent this major drawback by exploring succinct proof systems without trusted setup.

Decades of research in this area has provided a wealth of theories, algorithms and open-source systems to answer who/what types of questions. For example, who is the most influential in a social network? What items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? What Twitter poster is likely to go viral? Who can be grouped into the same online community? What financial transactions between users look suspicious? The state-of-the-art techniques on answering these questions have been widely adopted in various real-world applications, often with a strong empirical performance as well as a solid theoretic foundation. Despite the remarkable progress in network learning, a fundamental question largely remains nascent: how can we make network learning results and process explainable, transparent, and fair? The answer to this question benefits a variety of high-impact network learning based applications in terms of their interpretability, transparency and fairness, including social network analysis, neural science, team science and management, intelligent transportation systems, critical infrastructures, and blockchain networks.<br/><br/>This project takes a shift for network learning, from answering who and what to answering how and why. It develops computational theories, algorithms and prototype systems in the context of network learning, forming three key pillars of fair network learning. The first pillar (interpretation) focuses on explaining the network learning results and process to end users, who are often not machine learning experts. In particular, this project develops theory and metrics to quantify the quality of explanations for network learning. Based on that, it brings explainability to network learning algorithms by carefully balancing the model fidelity and model interpretability. The second pillar (auditing) makes the network learning process transparent to end-users, focusing on demonstrating how the learning results of a given network learning algorithm relate to the underlying network structure. In particular, it develops a new fairness measure to accommodate the non-independent-and-identically-distributed nature of network learning. Based on this new fairness measure, it develops an algorithmic framework to audit a variety of network learning algorithms. The third pillar (de-biasing) explores how to mitigate potential biases to ensure fair network learning. Underpinning these pillars is a human-in-the-loop visual analytics framework to support users in identifying and mitigating bias in network learning. By assimilating the research outcome into the courses and summer programs that the research team has developed, this project trains students to value the spirit of fairness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues. One of the most critical steps in addressing food insecurity is to improve understanding of the resources required and the challenges faced in procurement, distribution, access, and utilization of food resources in underserved communities. On the demand side, stakeholders must identify the nutritional needs, cultural preferences, and food preparation equipment and supplies of food-insecure households. If an individual does not know what a particular food is nor how to prepare it, it will go to waste, and the efforts of the food charity ecosystem will fail. On the supply side, stakeholders must streamline logistics and improve communication and coordination to optimize the supply chain (upstream procurement and downstream distribution) to minimize inefficiencies and coordinate the efforts of various food charities.<br/> <br/>Through a community-driven approach, this project brings together civic collaborators with university researchers to develop and build a locally-oriented food charity ecosystem based on data-driven smart technologies in the Greater Houston region. Our socio-technical approach addresses four overall research questions: (1) How can we redefine, model, and predict food deserts? (2) How can we minimize food waste? (3) How can we impact nutrition literacy? (4) How can we measure the health effects of having access to culturally appropriate nutritious food?<br/>These questions drive the following objectives: (i) Assess, model, and predict geographic areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food; (ii) Analyze communities to find untapped strengths in preparing culturally appropriate recipes and transfer this knowledge to like-minded community members, (iii) Build infrastructure for food pantries to provide culturally appropriate food they have in stock and recipes/food preparation instructions, (iv) Create a blockchain-based marketplace for food donations, (v) Develop educational material in multiple languages and partner with Community Health Workers to disseminate it, and (vi) Measure the health effects of having access to culturally appropriate nutritious food.<br/>Our multidisciplinary team brings together researchers in computer science, urban planning, community engagement, nutrition education/community healthy lifestyle program development, supply chain, measurement and evaluation, and a diverse set of ?on the ground? practitioner partners. Our team is focused on turning research into action. The decision-making tools will be disseminated to other food ecosystem members to address all aspects of culturally aware food distribution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important aspects of a city's infrastructure is the electric power grid. When a natural disaster occurs, parts of the electric grid become damaged and cannot properly function. In current systems, the information of the status of each component of the grid is collected by a central unit that will then proceed to send control information to all subsystems to maintain the grid working. This scheme does not work during natural disasters due to the large number of failures. This work will use distributed algorithms for managing the grid under natural disaster conditions.<br/> <br/>The project proposes the development of a blockchain-based power system resource availability tracking algorithm that can track the status of power system components even with communication failures. In addition, a hierarchical decision-making algorithm for real-time power system operation under severe damage conditions will be developed. This will advance the state of the art of Internet of Things in critical infrastructure systems and will advance algorithm development for resilient real-time power system operation during natural disasters. The proposed hierarchical decision-making algorithm will consider dynamic system islanding and make decisions based on system resource availability and network topology flexibility in the real time.<br/><br/>The outcome of this research will provide models for decentralized operations of power systems under extreme conditions. This will in turn improve the resilience of power systems, which in turn reduce economic losses caused by natural disasters and improve the quality of life for people suffering from natural disasters. The project will set a foundation for the decentralized operations of different critical infrastructure systems and improve their resilience against natural disasters.

The consumption of disposable consumer products drives many environmental challenges, including waste and pollution streams with global impact. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption and waste by cycling products and materials back into production. A convergence team of engineers, economists, anthropologists, and environmental assessment experts will work to develop the knowledge needed to achieve circular economies by closing and slowing resource loops. <br/><br/>To address closing resource loops, the research team will examine the technical and scientific challenges of how to formulate, produce, and use material resources to reduce consumption and environmental impact while also creating new ways to sustainably cycle these resources back into use at end-of-life. Plastic products serve as a key case study, with an emphasis on molecularly-designed products for disassembly and reuse. The project includes research on a recyclable thermoset composite system which can be ""uncured,"" separated, and collected for reuse. A general equilibrium behavioral-economic model that incorporates insights from psychology and anthropology and considers non-optimizing, highly-socialized behaviors will be used to consider associated economic, business, and environmental factors. To address slowing resource loops, the researchers will focus on design standardization and new business models to extend product value. They will also explore the integration and development of blockchain for asset and material tracking. The creation of knowledge with stakeholder input will inform innovative technical and science-based advances, engagement approaches, and novel business models. Using Complexity Leadership Theory and network analysis, members of the project will study convergence research in action and design interventions to strengthen connections within the research team.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They typically involve distributed computation across many interconnected servers in large data centers. The increasing number of applications and the rapidly growing scale of datacenters are driving a strong need for fast, dynamic and economic changes in the interconnection patterns among datacenter servers. To address this, this project will make use of optical circuit switches, which can handle large data traffic flows with sparse connection patterns.  It will develop scheduling algorithms to manage when to connect servers via these switches, taking into account practical constraints associated with the switching hardware as well as practical systems constraints. Addressing this challenge will enable more efficient use of data center resources for data analytics and other computationally intensive tasks. <br/><br/>This project addresses the problem of fast dynamic switching for adaptation to datacenter traffic patterns.  In particular it investigates the issue of balancing the overhead of reconfiguring circuit switches with the capability of dynamically meeting traffic demand requirements. The project will design scalable scheduling algorithms for hybrid switches (combination of optical circuit switches and electronic packet switches) with direct applications to modern data centers, addressing a wide range of practical requirements. These goals are addressed via a two-step approach: (a) Systems modeling, i.e. deriving canonical models of the optimization problems underlying the constraints of the hardware (speed, connectivity constraints and switching costs) as well as practical system requirements (such as throughput and tail latency); (b)  Principled algorithms: deriving scalable scheduling solutions with formal optimality guarantees by conducting a first-principles study of the underlying mixed continuous/combinatorial optimization problems.  The output of this project is expected to impact both practical networking designs of modern data centers as well as the development of next generation optical switches with high connectivity and small switching costs."

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The concept of microgrid is emerging in conjunction with the smart grid wherein small segments of the grid can be isolated into self-sufficient islands to feed their own demand load with their local energy, e.g., wind, solar. To date, microgrids begin to develop cooperative models for further improving the performance of global and local load management, such as global/local load balancing, energy exchange, and power transmission network topology design/upgrade with the integration of microgrids. However, all the cooperation among microgrids requests them to explicitly share their local sensitive grid operational information for global performance optimization, and thus compromises the privacy of microgrids. Then, microgrids' privacy concerns would impede the development and implementation of the cooperative models such that significant benefits via microgrids' cooperation on the power grid may not be available. This project tackles the privacy concerns in such cooperation, and enables microgrids to efficiently manage their local loads as well as facilitate the main grid to manipulate the global load with limited disclosure.<br/><br/>This project proposes a suite of novel privacy preserving cooperative models/techniques for distributed microgrids to efficiently advance load management on the power grid. Provable privacy/security is ensured in the end-to-end process of cooperation, including privately analyzing data collected from different microgrids and privately implementing the schemes/solutions derived from the cooperative models, by composing cryptographic primitives with the secure multiparty computation (SMC) theory and/or imposing defined rigorous privacy notions. Ensuring privacy protection with rigorous standards will allow data to be collected and used in ways that were prohibitive earlier due to the privacy concerns, and then improve both operational efficiency and user acceptance. Load management via privacy preserving cooperation further optimally allocates distributed energy and minimizes the transmission and storage costs in a more secure, reliable and efficient smart grid infrastructure. This project also integrates research and education by exciting undergraduates to join the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) research."

Specifically, in the manufacturing sector, IIoT systems are often deployed in harsh and complex environments and have to satisfy system-level dependability, timing performance, energy-efficiency, and security requirements. Moreover, IIoT technology can be leveraged to optimize the quality of products and the productivity of manufacturing lines and avoid process anomalies and faults that can lead to subpar performance and safety issues. However, these unique opportunities brought by IIoT pose challenges in their communication fabric design, distributed data management, analysis and decision making, and security protection. This CCRI planning proposal describes the planning activities underpinning the design of an innovative software-defined IIoT infrastructure to be jointly deployed at the three participating institutions, which will serve as a unified test-bed for a broad range of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) researchers. It is envisioned that this proposed infrastructure will enable and support a large number of IIoT related research projects in the broader CISE community. It will vastly advance the adoption of IIoT technology, accelerate the transformation of legacy communication infrastructure to advanced networking and computing infrastructure, and boost the nation's economic growth and competitiveness.<br/><br/>The proposed novel IIoT community infrastructure is motivated by the observed limitations of existing IIoT test-beds in the research community. These limitations include (i) a lack of deployment in real-life manufacturing environments and (ii) the inability to support heterogeneous network structures and scalable network management and data analytics. To address these limitations, this project will utilize established community outreach venues to reach out to the relevant CISE research communities to best understand the community needs and their expectations for the proposed infrastructure.  The proposed IIoT community research infrastructure will be the first of its kind that (a) combines software-defined networking (SDN) backbone and software-defined radio (SDR)-based real-time wireless edge networks into a hybrid communication fabric to emulate a variety of industrial networking environments; (b) provides a hierarchical real-time computing platform for real-time IIoT system monitoring, analysis and decision making; and (c) organizes the edge computing facilities deployed at individual sites into a multi-site IIoT Blockchain network to support research on distributed data management technologies. The flexibility and configurability of the proposed infrastructure at both device and system levels will enable diverse communities of CISE researchers to access the test-bed, deploy their protocols, algorithms and applications, and experimentally validate new ideas and innovations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A generation ago, law and social science scholars outlined a new paradigm for legal scholarship, focusing on social, economic and political variables in the interpretation and execution of the law. Today, algorithmic processes, data analytics and ubiquitous social and mobile computing pose new opportunities for the study of the effects of law, rules, and social norms. These new opportunities invite the use of new methodological techniques in law and social science research. Yet few law and social science scholars are trained to understand these new computational processes. This is a pilot of a collaborative, multidisciplinary, cross-campus network brought together to plan and train the next generation of law and social science scholars in algorithmic processes, data analytics and the opportunities presented by ubiquitous social and mobile computing. It is for the development of a faculty board, new curriculum, and new training activities to be centered primarily at a Technology, Law and Society Summer Institute. The goal is to develop the updated training necessary to ensure that the next generation of socio-legal scholars are equipped to utilize new methodological techniques and new sites of inquiry. <br/><br/>Just as the consideration of ""law-in-action"" shifted the paradigm for legal research by expanding it beyond the exegesis of law as written and into the domain of what judges, lawyers and citizens actually do with law and how they understand it in practice, the interface between law and computer-based and other computational systems offers the opportunity for a new paradigm shift in socio-legal studies. The proposed series of trainings, workshops and a summer institute will equip law and social science scholars to develop methods for the study of these new legal objects and relationships. During the academic year, participants will test methods and formats for cross-training and collaboration. The broader impacts include training new researchers and helping existing law and social science scholars to re-tool; collaborating with the technology and policy communities to bring law and social science research to bear on their activities; and fostering cross-disciplinary, cross-campus collaborations."

The envisioned future engine has the potential to transform innovation deserts in the region into strong economic contributors and generators of high-quality employment opportunities.  The region of service includes 26 counties in North Texas and Southeastern Oklahoma.  Logistics represents the second largest business sector, with over 889 million tons valued at $1.1 trillion moving through the region and employing over 450,000 workers.  Like the national economy, the region is experiencing a significant shortfall in skilled labor.   In June 2022, over 500,000 logistics job openings existed nationally, with the driver shortfall alone at over 80,000.  These shortages are particularly pronounced in the region as the second-largest industrial and fourth-largest freight market. A collaboration of universities, companies, government agencies, and workforce development organizations will lead the activity, including the University of North Texas, Southern Methodist University, University of Texas-Arlington, Dallas College, Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Texas Research Alliance, Dallas Regional Chamber, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Hillwood Properties, City of Dallas, Workforce Solutions, and the Southern Dallas County Inland Port Transportation Management Association.<br/> <br/>The project will solicit use-inspired projects from the logistics community and address through research hubs located in disadvantaged areas to translate emerging technologies into innovative systems, practices, and workforce development programs. These hubs will conceptualize new products and services, incubate start-ups, and facilitate commercialization.  The envisioned future engine will incorporate three major technical thrusts:  autonomy, electrification, and cyber.  Autonomy integrates autonomous systems into logistics networks by generating innovations in surveillance/sending, computer vision, collision avoidance, object tracking, and smart city technologies. Cyber advances the technologies necessary for integrating logistics functions, data, and software across the supply chain, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, cybersecurity, optimization, and digital twins.  Electrification facilitates sustainable logistics by promoting innovations in renewable energy generation and microgrids, energy storage, battery technologies, hydrogen fuels, on-the-move EV wireless charging, energy harvesting, and grid resilience.  Workforce development overlays each thrust, and the project will closely collaborate with regional workforce development organizations to plan and develop new education vehicles and integrate these innovations and industry input into workforce training programs.  The Development Award will enable the creation of the Engine by promoting collaboration across universities, government and non-government entities, and logistics companies throughout the region and providing the support essential for creating the research hubs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to CompTIA?s 2022 Workforce and Learning Trends report, U.S. tech employment will grow an estimated 12.4 million net jobs in 2022 alone. Over the next ten years, technology occupations are expected to grow at twice the rate of overall employment. Yet the high demand for skilled workers is confounded by workers leaving the field. According to Microsoft?s 2021 Work Trends Index, more than 40% of employees were considering a job change, and 46% planned to make a significant career move or transition. While traditional areas of technology are experiencing an increasing demand, there are also emerging job clusters. These include, but are not limited to, the following fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), IT Automation, Quantum Computing, DevOps, FinTech, Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Encryption Technologies, IoT/Edge Computing, 5G, and Blockchain Technology. Nationally, there are diversity gaps in the IT industry. Underserved and disadvantaged students are not well represented in pathways for careers in IT which often discourages these individuals from pursuing these career pathways. This project will bring together an experienced consortium of community colleges leaders in information technology collaborating with industry partners to create the National Information Technology Innovation Center (NITIC). <br/><br/>The Center will create a future-focused community of practice with diverse perspectives and geographic distribution. NITIC will focus on emerging technologies while strengthening and promoting proven best practices from prior ATE IT centers. NITIC will create new deliverables that develop high-quality educational materials, curricula, pedagogy, and teaching resources while consolidating access for existing materials across broad areas of information technology. The center will leverage a mix of experienced and emerging community college partners to serve as leaders within their technology clusters to expand collaboration and develop future leadership for the ATE community. The Center will produce, implement, assess impact, and broadly share the following: 1) Innovation clearinghouse to encourage new emerging IT curriculum and materials driven by a Business & Industry Leadership Team (BILT) Model for high employer engagement;  2) A Community of Practice: IT Innovation Network (ITIN) to promote sharing and problem-solving; 3) Faculty Professional Development Model ? Working Connections Virtual and In-Person Workshops to address continuing learning needs for faculty as technologies emerge; and  4) Dedicated models for increasing diversity and underserved population representation in IT, including veterans, women, and underserved student populations in STEM.

Cryptocurrency-backed initial coin offerings (ICOs) represent a novel form of venture financing that changes the scale and scope of investment as well as encouraging firm structures that maximize hospitable regulatory locations. The outcomes of these processes have important implications for the location of economic growth and wealth formation, particularly within the finance sector.  The project seeks to clarify how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector.  Findings will be disseminated via a variety of publications (academic and more general and using open access publishing), the distribution of  tools, code, and datasets developed for this project for gathering, cleaning and analyzing data via open-source tools and data such as GitHub, and through educational activities such as student training and classroom modules. <br/><br/>The contribution of this research is to demonstrate how novel financing practices associated with cryptocurrencies impact new firm formation within the technology sector. The research will advance theory and understanding within economic geography by looking specifically at financialization and the ways financial institutions and logics exert power in economic systems within these new spaces of finance.  The project has three specific objectives. The first is to determine the geographies of core cryptocurrency functions by asking: what factors contribute to the geographies of different cryptocurrency operations?  How are locations integrated with downstream operations such as ICOs? These questions will be answered using data-scraping and geolocation methods drawn from geospatial science and digital geographies. The second objective is to assesses how cryptocurrencies' uses and networks contribute to value. This will be addressed by using social network analysis, machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural nets from computational sociology and computer science to ask: how do networks of cryptocurrencies differ between use types? How does network interaction contribute to value? The third objective focuses on how cryptocurrencies affect financing and entrepreneurial practices within tech-based startups. The investigator will use interviews to gather data to answer: What are the motivations of investors/entrepreneurs in ICOs? and What additional functions are folded into the financing process?  Together these objectives will fundamentally advance basic knowledge in economic geography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The diverse applications spanned in this project include cloud computing, datacenters, blockchain technologies, and networks of mobile devices. What is the best algorithm to map a collection of communicating processes in a cloud of heterogeneous servers? How should a large AI computation be embedded in a network of computers? How can the data-flow needs of a distributed system be effectively supported by the underlying datacenter network? Can a highly dynamic network support fast and reliable communication?  The focus of this project is on developing a rigorous algorithmic framework for studying these questions and designing efficient algorithms for the relevant problems.<br/><br/>The PI endeavors to translate the advances in algorithmic foundations of these problems to tangible benefits in the applications. The integrated educational component of the project includes experimental and measurement studies, several concrete directions for dissertation research, and a new course on ""Algorithms for Modern Networked Systems"". As part of an effort to broaden participation in computer-science foundations, the PI plans to lecture on graphs and their applications at a summer institute for participating middle- and high-school teachers from Boston-area schools. The ultimate goal is to engage young students from these schools and suggest a possible academic and professional future in CS to a diverse community.<br/><br/>The technical core of the project comprises three categories of algorithmic problems. The first component is on embedding distributed computations in arbitrary network topologies, with an emphasis on modeling heterogeneity in both the computational tasks and the network machines. The expected research contributions include (a) resolving the complexity of the minimum-stretch graph-retraction problem, which is a natural variant of classic metric embeddings, and (b) approximation algorithms for the communication-aware embedding of directed acyclic graphs. The second component is on embedding flows and their generalizations called coflows, which capture flow collections sharing a common performance goal. The aim here is to minimize objectives related to the response times of the flows, for general networks. Both the first and second components assume that the underlying network does not change with time. The third component of this project concerns embedding in dynamic networks. It seeks distributed algorithms for information flows in highly dynamic networks, and solutions to several temporal optimization problems for networks with known dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It seeks to catalyze technological innovations using a coordinated approach that includes access to critical data, network analysis, distributed inference, identification of strategic points of intervention, and mitigation approaches to disrupt the flow of illegal, substandard, and falsified medicines (ISFM trade). The project will advance our Nation's ability to effectively disrupt trade in illicit and counterfeit pharmaceuticals to prevent offenders from adapting their modus operandi to circumvent controls and consequently undermine public health, revenue, competition, the rule of law, and impact national security. The research team's collaboration with industry and law enforcement agencies will facilitate an interactive process regarding disruption techniques. In addition, the collective effort is designed to launch discussions about new governance and social control models whereby government, private sector, and academic parties are motivated to share skills, knowledge, and data towards solving social problems. The solution to a social problem is built into a business model, which can serve in the handling of other similar challenges (e.g., corruption, terrorism, climate crisis, peacebuilding).<br/><br/>The project employs a multidisciplinary set of methods from criminology, computer science, and pharmacology to develop a multiplex network-enabled system that will identify points of intervention and can be used to coordinate efforts of stakeholders to disrupt illicit flows of the medical product, create consensual knowledge on the nature of the problem, and develop and populate a data infrastructure to disrupt illegal medical supply chains effectively so as to minimize the social harm they cause. Specially, this project will address five primary objectives: 1) use original and other research data to identify criminogenic asymmetries and control weaknesses in the ISFM trade; 2) mine distributed data to infer clusters and linkages, and construct a multiplex network from our aggregated data to discover topological & physical properties of ISFM networks and predict missing entities and connections between entities; 3) discover the most impactful failure modes using the cascading failures theory and validate the intervention strategy by extending the microfluidic, optical and quantitative testing platform (similar to PharmaChk) to incorporate robust, accurate, but inexpensive chemical tests for a shortlist of high-priority targets (antibiotics and anti-infectives) including opioids; 4) use internet of things and blockchain to enable highly instrumented producer-to-patient supply chains that enable detection of ICM trade; and 5) develop a framework and incentives for multi-stakeholder collaboration, and build a Social Accountability on ISFM Index to manage responses and enable collective (non-profit, private, public) action.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, the collective effort is designed to launch discussions about new governance and social control models whereby government, private sector, and academic parties are motivated to share skills, knowledge, and data towards solving social problems. The solution to a social problem is built into a business model, which can serve in the handling of other similar challenges (e.g., corruption, terrorism, climate crisis, peacebuilding).<br/><br/>The project employs a multidisciplinary set of methods from criminology, computer science, and pharmacology to develop a multiplex network-enabled system that will identify points of intervention and can be used to coordinate efforts of stakeholders to disrupt illicit flows of the medical product, create consensual knowledge on the nature of the problem, and develop and populate a data infrastructure to disrupt illegal medical supply chains effectively so as to minimize the social harm they cause. Specially, this project will address five primary objectives: 1) use original and other research data to identify criminogenic asymmetries and control weaknesses in the ISFM trade; 2) mine distributed data to infer clusters and linkages, and construct a multiplex network from our aggregated data to discover topological & physical properties of ISFM networks and predict missing entities and connections between entities; 3) discover the most impactful failure modes using the cascading failures theory and validate the intervention strategy by extending the microfluidic, optical and quantitative testing platform (similar to PharmaChk) to incorporate robust, accurate, but inexpensive chemical tests for a shortlist of high-priority targets (antibiotics and anti-infectives) including opioids; 4) use internet of things and blockchain to enable highly instrumented producer-to-patient supply chains that enable detection of ICM trade; and 5) develop a framework and incentives for multi-stakeholder collaboration, and build a Social Accountability on ISFM Index to manage responses and enable collective non-profit, private, and public action.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Achieving this vision of a 'speed-of-light Internet' could translate into significant value for today's applications; for example, shaving even a few hundred milliseconds from a Web transaction may translate into millions of dollars of revenue for a Web provider, or significantly impact emergency or defense response. The human visual system cannot correctly order visual events separated by less than about 30 millisecond; thus, a response received over the Internet within thirty milliseconds would achieve the illusion of an ""instant response"", potentially enabling the full potential of certain applications, e.g., tele-immersion, that have so far been limited to the laboratory.  For some applications, such as massive multi-player online games, (or any online interactive community), reducing the latency of the Internet will push applications to reach a critical mass of users. A speed-of-light Internet can also be expected to spur the development of new and creative applications. This proposal aims at developing a playbook for realizing a speed-of-light Internet, by identifying the factors that contribute to latency, the applications that would benefit most, and developing an architecture, protocols and methodologies for achieving it.<br/><br/><br/>The four main goals of this project are to (1) determine the impact of latency on end users, (2) design a speed-of-light Internet, (3) explore ""end-point agnostic"" mechanisms for reducing latency, and (4) determine how to operate, maintain, and make use of a bandwidth-constrained low-latency network. The project will investigate these questions in the context of candidate applications including electronic commerce, games, and virtual and augmented reality.  The proposed work includes new algorithms and design for the wide-area network infrastructure, and new protocols and network management to deal with the dynamic partitioning of application traffic across the two infrastructures.  The project will explore how to leverage low-latency networking technologies, i.e., microwave and millimeter wave radios, which have thus far been deployed as point-to-point links over long distances primarily for the financial industry; specifically, how they can be incorporated into the Internet at large. The work will be carried out in collaboration with McKay Brothers, the operators of an ultra-low-latency network linking financial markets in New York and Chicago, Akamai Technologies, a major provider of content delivery services, and Exablaze, a manufacturer of the ultra-low-latency network interface cards. This will inform the design of a cSpeed mesh network, and its interaction and interoperability with the standard Internet.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Critical systems include those associated with human safety (e.g., transportation, medical), the delivery of critical services (e.g., infrastructure, energy generation), humanitarian and military missions, and global economic stability. These systems are expensive to procure, must be supported for long periods, and the consequences, if compromised by counterfeit parts, can be catastrophic. This project will develop methods of disrupting the counterfeit hardware networks for critical systems guided by socio-technical network development and modeling, and through consideration of the counterfeiting network?s connections to other illicit trafficking networks. Counterfeit hardware addressed in this project includes electronic and non-electronic hardware and hardware that is created via additive manufacturing. The work performed in this project will inform decisions and policies about the economy, security, and resilience of the Nation and the world concerning illicit supply networks for counterfeit parts. <br/><br/>The majority of the treatment of the counterfeit part problem to date is focused on the detection of counterfeits, which is necessary, but represents treating the symptom, not the cause. In this project, we will conduct a series of workshops that include stakeholders from industry, policy, legal, supply chain, government acquisition, industrial security, and anti-trafficking organizations. The workshops will be used to guide socio-technical network development and modeling, and include consideration of the counterfeiting network?s connections to other illicit trafficking networks. The technical attributes of the problem include: part flows within sustainment networks for critical systems, procurement and acquisition practices, counterfeit detection technologies, and inventory management. The socio-attributes include trust, communication (including significant counterfeit reporting stigmas), and incentive reactions. The network models developed will consider both commercial transactions and military acquisition systems to enable identification of possible points of disruption in those networks. The model for the counterfeit part network developed in this project will form an important and necessary enabler for possible future blockchain-based solutions and is an essential component of a digital twin for the supply chain for critical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

EI2-SURI is significant because it supports two critical needs in cybersecurity and workforce development in relation to securing the national defense.As the various types of cyber threats continue to increase, so has the demand for trained cybersecurity professionals. This has resulted in a serious shortage of qualified professionals in the private and public sectors. EI2-SURI proposes to build the capacity for ten traditionally underrepresented minorities annually. The fellows are recruited from the Mid-Atlantic region, the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia (DMV) and Prince George's County where Bowie State University resides. Fellows are provided with real-world research explorations and experiences in cybersecurity. The results of planned projects will be enhanced student competency in research-related activities, advanced academic skills and increased diversity in STEM fields. The success of the proposed efforts is sustained by the integration of evidenced-based strategies related to establishing communities of learning. These communities include faculty mentors, graduate and undergraduate fellows and cybersecurity alumni, who are actively engaged in research.<br/><br/>EI2-SURI is actively engaging a diverse community in the investigation of cybersecurity issues related to vulnerability tracking in industrial control systems, analysis of software vulnerability; secure software design and testing, malware detection, and network security. Specifically, the following interdisciplinary cyber-related investigations optimize the best solutions to prevent and detect vulnerabilities: (1) Vulnerability Tracking in industrial control systems for Supervisory, Control, and Data Acquisition Systems designed to mitigate the risk to critical control systems, by demonstrating the feasibility of monitoring the execution of embedded Linux Kernel modules; (2) Analysis of Software Vulnerability to use visual analytics to deliver actionable security intelligence to defend software systems; (3) Security of Blockchain to compare various hardware, encryption algorithms, and implementation approaches; and (4) Network Systems' Data breaches to assess current vulnerability management protocols. The method used will include approaches such as data analytics and event log mining. Additionally, project-based learning will be used to actively engage the research community. To support the research and successfully build the community, the program planning and organization is structured around key activities including the program start-up package and orientation; research project development and implementation, weekly start up, weekly research forum; various seminars and workshops such as attending graduate school and monetizing intellectual property, industry and agency visits; andthe program culminating research symposium.

Unfortunately, this ideal is rarely realized. Protocol experts are rare and their techniques are too complicated for solo network engineers to use, who instead just follow informal ""best practices."" As a result, most of these protocols end up with security problems. This research investigates an automated protocol expert that provides the network engineer with the service normally given by the human protocol expert. The availability of this open-source expert will broadly impact the trustworthiness of cyberspace by increasing the security and reliability of the online services that use it.<br/><br/>The PI will construct this expert after three technical advances: first, a new security property specification language based on protocol goals, as opposed to the details of the operation of a protocol, for use by network engineers; second, a new theory of protocol construction based on the composition of disjoint authentication protocols with restrictions from linear logic used to limit the sharing of sensitive information; and third, a theory of protocol optimization based on the attack calculus already used to prove that protocols are secure.

A related exciting emerging trend driven by access challenges is in-memory computing, whereby computations are offloaded from the main processing units to the memory to reduce transfer time and energy. The challenges of future rapid storage access and in-memory computing cannot be addressed by the conventional storage architectures that inevitably trade off reliability and capacity for latency. This bottleneck calls for innovative research contributions that can simultaneously maximize the storage density, access performance, and computing functionality. This project addresses this imminent challenge by developing principled mathematical foundations that will underpin future computing systems possessing qualities necessary to address new data-intensive applications, focusing on fundamental performance bounds, algorithms, and practical channel coding methods. The results of this project will be demonstrated on modern data-driven and machine learning applications, will advance the repertoire of mathematical techniques in information sciences, and will directly impact future computer system architectures to meet the growing and wide ranging societal and scientific needs for computing and rapid data processing. Additionally, the proposal offers several mechanisms for broader impacts, including engagement with data storage and memory industry through the existing research center that the principal investigator is leading at UCLA, curriculum development and the introduction of new graduate courses in the UCLA on-line master's program in engineering, engagement of undergraduate researchers, and dissemination of the results through survey-style articles and tutorials.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: <br/><br/>The project has the following three complementary research goals:<br/><br/>1) Invention of new channel codes for reliable and fast memory access for latency sensitive applications, with the study spanning general memories and specific schemes for resistive memories in particular.

Such contracts can implement new, decentralized financial instruments or even virtual corporations defined only by the bundle of smart contracts programmatically governing their behavior.  For example, an eBay-like smart contract could directly connect buyers with sellers, support a variety of auction mechanisms, and manage necessary payments (including escrow), without the transaction charges currently imposed by eBay, PayPal, and the credit card companies.  In general, moving business processes into smart contracts promises to lower costs, reduce friction, and unleash innovation by eliminating intermediaries and automating settlements. However, programming smart contracts requires a deep understanding of cryptographic techniques, a non-standard execution cost model, and economic mechanism design.  Existing smart-contract programming languages provide little support for such reasoning; indeed, contract vulnerabilities (such as TheDAO) have already led to multi-million-dollar thefts.  In contrast, this project will develop new techniques and tools to support the development of high-assurance smart contracts, with an emphasis on the challenges that make such contracts particularly difficult to write correctly.<br/><br/>This project will address the unique challenges of writing high-assurance smart contracts by designing a new high-level language, Solidified, that allows a programmer to express both the intent of the contract and its design constraints (e.g., bounds on resource usage, synchronicity or secrecy requirements, or economic expectations).  We will develop tools to analyze and compile such contracts into executable code. At a high-level, Solidified will support high-assurance smart-contract writing across three dimensions.  First, Solidified will mix automatic and annotation-driven compilation to a diverse set of underlying cryptographic primitives necessary to provide the security smart contracts require.  The compilation process will be integrated with tools for automated resource analysis that will compute tight bounds on the amount of gas a smart contract uses.  Resource analysis, in turn, will enable automated reasoning about higher-level properties, particularly those with an economic flavor.  For example, given a contract, new analysis tools, using probabilistic resource analysis, will determine whether a player's expected payoff is maximized by following the protocol, indicating whether it is incentive compatible.  Extending the analysis across contracts will evaluate whether systemic risks are understood and mitigated.  This project's foundational work in high-assurance smart contracts will help realize the vision of blockchain technology.

The NSF's CyberCorps SFS program funds projects that address Cybersecurity education and workforce development. The Scholarship Track provides funding to award scholarships to students in Cybersecurity. In return for their scholarships, recipients will work after graduation for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in a position related to Cybersecurity for a period equal to the length of the scholarship. The Capacity Track seeks innovative proposals leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce Cybersecurity professionals. <br/><br/>The curriculum includes practical, hands-on applications of Cybersecurity coordinated between the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department, the Information Technology (IT) Program, the Institute for Complex Additive Systems Analysis (ICASA), and other academic departments. By integrating research projects in advanced courses, the project enhances problem solving and develops CyberCorps SFS scholars who are subject matter experts in the area of their selected focus. The underlying curriculum principle is to integrate Cybersecurity content in every core CSE and IT course from algorithms and architecture to software engineering. For example, in the software engineering course, students learn best practices on software design and verification for security; in the compiler writing course, students learn the security implications of design decisions in compilers; and during their compiler implementation project, they implement a security optimization such as buffer overflow protection.

This project will identify and exploit the insight that mobile data and the device sensor streams simultaneously captured, necessarily bear certain relations.  This research plays a fundamental role in establishing the credibility of mobile and social media, acting as the required witness to the authenticity of reported data.  Applications with important social impact include citizen journalism, smart city management and prototype verification.<br/><br/>The project will investigate, develop and evaluate a framework for secure and efficient sensor-based mobile data verification mechanisms. In a first thrust, the team will leverage TrustZone to build a trusted mobile device platform, to bootstrap trust into sensor readings captured on the device, and provide secure storage and a secure execution environment for sensitive functions. In a second thrust, the team will devise solutions to securely and efficiently capture, authenticate, communicate, archive, search and access mobile device sensor snapshots (""sensorprints""). Finally, the team will develop mechanisms to verify the consistency between mobile data and simultaneously captured sensor streams.

The energy cost of data centers rivals that of medium sized countries. Traditional content distribution network designs have involved centralized capital-intensive infrastructure. For scalable performance, next generation content distribution networks will have to harness the ""edge-cloud,"" consisting of vast numbers of highly capable end user devices such as smart phones, tablets, and e-readers. In this project we address the issues of models, fundamental limits, and storage and delivery algorithms associated with the distributed nature of next generation content distribution networks.  The main goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory for characterizing the fundamental capacity and performance limits of such networks, and to design the associated content storage and distribution algorithms to achieve these limits. <br/><br/>Content distribution networks generate the vast majority of all internet traffic, and we expect our results to guide the next generation of such networks.  In particular, we explore ways to support robust and efficient distributed storage and delivery of content over heterogeneous networks. An integral and key aspect of our proposal is to closely tie the theoretical and conceptual aspects of the project with the practical and real-world engineering issues.

Such memory types include technologies such as phase-change memory, spin-transfer-torque magnetoresistive memory, and resistive memory. As these emerging memory technologies mature, it is important for computer architects to understand their pros and cons in a comprehensive manner in order to improve the performance, power, and reliability of future computer systems incorporating these systems which will be used in various application domains. Yet, most of previous research on NVM architecture is focused only on the performance, power, and density benefits and how to overcome challenges, such as write overhead and wearout issues. The non-volatility characteristic of NVM technologies is not fully explored. Therefore, this project examines how to exploit the non-volatility characteristic that distinguishes the emerging NVM technologies from traditional memory technologies, and investigate new memory architecture design with novel applications.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance the memory architecture design of various types of computer systems with a full exploration of the non-volatility characteristic of NVM technologies across architecture, system, and application levels. To this end, the project explores the design space of various types of computer systems, ranging from severs to embedded systems.  In particular, the project identifies and addresses design issues in nonvolatile cache architecture, re-architects main memory structure to leverage the non-volatility characteristic to improve system performance and energy consumption, supports persistent memory systems in various use cases with emerging NVM technologies, and studies near-data-computing techniques applied for these NVM technologies. The successful outcome of this research is expected to provide the design guidelines for enabling both large capacity and fast-bandwidth nonvolatile memory/storage, which are beyond the present state-of-the-art. Consequently, the research will spawn new applications involving the computation on the exascale of data, e.g., data mining, machine learning, visual or auditory sensory data recognition, bio-informatics, etc.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shifting accessibility and agility of manufacturing from factories to owner-operated 3D printers can accelerate cycle times, spur innovation among American companies, and in some cases reduce the risks associated with product development.

We will focus initially on concrete examples to show potential for new modes of prototyping and collaboration at the nexus of 3D printing and distributed ledgers.  Initial archetypes focus on thermoplastics that can be 3D printed and assembled in a modular manner, beginning with small parts less than 25 cm in length. In the process of designing and 3D printing these products, we are also creating a database of industrial design motifs enabling larger objects to be constructed from reusable component parts. This system will coordinate a network of privately owned 3D printers; when a customer places an order, each individual part will be shipped to the customer from collaborators with 3D printers. As industrial design motifs is recorded in an open manner, the success of a motif is closely linked to the creator of the work, incentivizing collaborative and iterative product development by closely tying the success of a product to the individuals who contributed to its design and fabrication.

Future many-cores, to stay on the historical performance curve, will contain more transistors than can all be sustainably powered at the same time.  Thus, we face the prospect of ?dark silicon,? wherein some of a chip?s components must be powered-off (darkened) in order to stay within the chip?s power/thermal budget. Ensuring peak performance under these circumstances is a challenging task. In particular, in an architecture with different types of components (cores, caches, network on chip (NoC, or on-chip interconnet), memory controllers, etc.), there can be many different on-dim-dark configurations within the power budget. However, these can exhibit significantly varying performances. Additionally, the power consumption of uncore components (shared caches, on-chip interconnect, memory architecture) is significant, thus the uncore components play an important role in joint performance/power/thermal optimization. Therefore, a more inclusive approach is needed. Our architectural design space exploration will mainly focus on the uncore space (shared caches, on-chip interconnect structures, memory architecture), targeting future NoC-based many-core microprocessors that exploit the emerging technologies of 3D die-stacking (3D IC) and non-volatile memories (NVM).<br/> <br/>This project  will advance the state of the art in preparing for the dark silicon revolution in two main aspects. 1) Cross-layer holistic optimization with a focus on uncore components: The uncore components play important roles in joint performance/power/thermal optimization. This project proposes an integrated approach in which the cores and uncore components collaborate to maximize performance under power and thermal constraints as well as under dynamically changing program behavior and execution parameters.   2) Investigating dark silicon in the context of emerging technologies:  Emerging 3D ICs and NVM technologies are envisioned as promising ways to design future many-core architectures. The adoption of such emerging technologies poses new challenges for dark silicon (such as aggravated thermal profiles in 3D stacked chips), but also brings new opportunities for architectural innovations such as novel power management techniques and greater exploitation of memory system heterogeneity. The broader impact of this project includes the contribution to the increased performance for future microprocessors even in the face of the coming dark silicon revolution.   Through close collaboration with several industry partners, the PIs envision direct transfer of many ideas to industry.  The tools and techniques developed in this project will be used in teaching existing courses and developing new courses, and will be made   available through the web for use by other educators, researchers, and industry practitioners. Dissemination of research findings will also be carried out through conference tutorials, panel discussions, and workshops.

Meanwhile, near-threshold computing (NTC) emerges as a promising solution to improve energy efficiency by reducing the supply voltage, making it attractive for a broad range of applications from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to cloud computing facilities. With the anticipated adoption of NTC in mainstream computing systems, security vulnerabilities that are unique to NTC will be ripe for exploitation. The objective of this project is to, for the first time, address NTC security concerns by performing a thorough and systematic investigation of its unique vulnerabilities to Side-Channel Attack (SCA) - attacks that rely on information leaked from the physical implementation of a cryptosystem.<br/>Side-channel attacks are perhaps one of the most covert and sophisticated among cyber threats. <br/><br/>Instead of treating security as an after-thought in traditional hardware development, in this project, we explore early-stage preventative methods to identify secure concerns in the design phase across different hardware implementation layers, and investigate the fundamental trade-off between efficiency and security in computing systems. Our investigation of the security implications of NTC will provide critical insights and methodologies for designing future efficient and secure computing systems. Due to its multi-disciplinary nature, our research project will promote the development and training of a strong workforce well-versed in the critical security domain across circuit design, computer architecture, and cryptography."

It is of paramount importance to develop embedded processing systems that are hardened to withstand these remote attacks while continuing to operate effectively. Since embedded systems are often used in real-time environments with lightweight operating systems and limited processing and power resources, conventional software solutions for malware detection are not suitable in this domain. Instead, architectural solutions that are specialized to embedded processing systems are necessary. <br/><br/>This project develops a comprehensive attack detection and mitigation system that is based on hardware monitors that are co-located with the embedded processor. The hardware monitor tracks the operation of the processor and compares each executed instruction with a model of the application that was created by analyzing the original binary. Changes in operation caused by an attack can be detected within one cycle, and recovery steps can be taken. The proposed system does not require any changes to the software running on the processor and does not cause any reduction in processing speed.

The solution to a social problem is built into a business model, which can serve in the handling of other similar challenges (e.g., corruption, terrorism, climate crisis, peacebuilding).<br/><br/>The project employs a multidisciplinary set of methods from criminology, computer science, and pharmacology to develop a multiplex network-enabled system that will identify points of intervention and can be used to coordinate efforts of stakeholders to disrupt illicit flows of the medical product, create consensual knowledge on the nature of the problem, and develop and populate a data infrastructure to disrupt illegal medical supply chains effectively so as to minimize the social harm they cause. Specially, this project will address five primary objectives: 1) use original and other research data to identify criminogenic asymmetries and control weaknesses in the ISFM trade; 2) mine distributed data to infer clusters and linkages, and construct a multiplex network from our aggregated data to discover topological & physical properties of ISFM networks and predict missing entities and connections between entities; 3) discover the most impactful failure modes using the cascading failures theory and validate the intervention strategy by extending the microfluidic, optical and quantitative testing platform (similar to PharmaChk) to incorporate robust, accurate, but inexpensive chemical tests for a shortlist of high-priority targets (antibiotics and anti-infectives) including opioids; 4) use internet of things and blockchain to enable highly instrumented producer-to-patient supply chains that enable detection of ICM trade; and 5) develop a framework and incentives for multi-stakeholder collaboration, and build a Social Accountability on ISFM Index to manage responses and enable collective (non-profit, private, public) action.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This impact ranges widely from causing diseases to offering new kinds of antibiotics, to helping crops grow by fixing nitrogen in the soil. Metagenomics is the study of such microbial communities through their extracted DNA. One of the first questions to ask when studying such a community is: ""which organisms are present and at what abundance?""  Most current approaches to this so-called community profiling problem take a parsimonious approach: infer the presence of the fewest organisms possible that still agrees with the observed data. However, treating each organism as completely different from any other can lead to mis-estimates of the different kinds and amounts of organisms present, referred to as biological diversity. This is further complicated by the fact that historically there has been much disagreement about the proper way to analytically measure biological diversity. In this project, the investigators leverage a recently defined, unifying notion of biological diversity to address the problem of correctly profiling a microbial community which has in it organisms of varying similarity. To accomplish this, a new mathematical framework is put forward that utilizes the big data approach of compressive sensing. After advancing the mathematical theory, the investigators will create a software implementation that will allow biomedical researchers to study metagenomic communities while properly accounting for varying organism similarity.  While advancing discovery, this project promotes graduate and undergraduate student teaching and learning. In particular, students are guided to excel at interdisciplinary work in the fields of mathematics and biology. Furthermore, beyond the traditional dissemination routes of conferences and papers, a wide audience is also engaged through a collaboration with SciShow, a popular YouTube channel that will work with the PIs in creating episodes featuring metagenomics suitable for the general public.<br/><br/>Microorganismal community profiling, determining the identity and relative abundance of all microbial organisms present in a given environmental sample through their sequenced DNA, is an important first step in the study of such communities. Many tools and approaches have been proposed to profile microbial communities, and while these tools take advantage of particular properties of microbial genetics to perform the classification task, there is a general lack of rigorous mathematical approaches that allow for definitive statements to be made about such classifications. Furthermore, the estimated biological diversity of a community can vary widely depending on the computational approach used. This is problematic given that biological diversity is a key metric when studying the impact of a bacterial community on its surrounding environment and aberrations of this quantity have been implicated in a number of diseases. This difficulty is further compounded by the fact that there is much disagreement in the scientific community on how to measure biodiversity. Recently, however, it was shown that a single formula subsumes and unifies many of the most popular biodiversity measures. In this project, the PIs utilize this definition of biodiversity to develop a rigorous mathematical approach to simultaneously profile a microbial community and characterize its biological diversity. Mathematically, this reduces to developing (and proving results about) an optimization procedure where the objective function includes biological diversity. Intriguingly, such an approach parallels that of compressive sensing and other such ""big data"" sparsity promoting optimization routines. The main approach will be to reduce this measure of biodiversity to a quasinorm and appropriately modify existing proofs about the convergence and guaranteed reconstruction of such optimization routines. This will result in an optimization framework that allows for simultaneously profiling a microbial community and characterizing its biodiversity directly while considering organism similarity. This will be implemented in user-friendly software and used to analyze gut samples from healthy and sick pre-term infants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this collaborative effort involving the University of California at Davis and Harvard University, the PIs will focus on the design and implementation of parallel hash tables, one of the most fundamental of data structures, on the new platforms.  Real-time parallel hashing would enable a variety of graphics applications on dynamically changing data, including spatial hashing, surface and image matching, and hashed octrees which in turn enable a host of other applications including Boolean surface operations, point-cloud nearest neighbors, ray-tracing acceleration and photon mapping.  In prior work, the PIs built a baseline implementation that shows effective parallel hashing can be done on the GPU; they can construct the table as quickly as the fastest available radix sort, and can execute parallel random access on the elements much more quickly than binary search.  In the current research, the PIs plan to improve upon their baseline implementation significantly, while also focusing on related structures such as multi-maps and Bloom filters.  New designs and construction algorithms will be developed, implemented, and analyzed with respect to performance, and then applied to a variety of computer graphics applications. The PIs expect this work to lead to interesting theoretical results; modern hash table constructions have never been considered in the parallel context, so finding the right model for analysis is one goal of the research.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  This project will contribute to the computing infrastructure, not only for computer graphics but also for general-purpose computation.  The PIs will distribute their implementations freely, in part by extending and building upon their existing (and popular) library of general-purpose data structures (the CUDA Data Parallel Primitives).

The consumption of disposable consumer products drives many environmental challenges, including waste and pollution streams with global impact. A circular economy aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption and waste by cycling products and materials back into production. A convergence team of engineers, economists, anthropologists, and environmental assessment experts will work to develop the knowledge needed to achieve circular economies by closing and slowing resource loops. <br/><br/>To address closing resource loops, the research team will examine the technical and scientific challenges of how to formulate, produce, and use material resources to reduce consumption and environmental impact while also creating new ways to sustainably cycle these resources back into use at end-of-life. Plastic products serve as a key case study, with an emphasis on molecularly-designed products for disassembly and reuse. The project includes research on a recyclable thermoset composite system which can be ""uncured,"" separated, and collected for reuse. A general equilibrium behavioral-economic model that incorporates insights from psychology and anthropology and considers non-optimizing, highly-socialized behaviors will be used to consider associated economic, business, and environmental factors. To address slowing resource loops, the researchers will focus on design standardization and new business models to extend product value. They will also explore the integration and development of blockchain for asset and material tracking. The creation of knowledge with stakeholder input will inform innovative technical and science-based advances, engagement approaches, and novel business models. Using Complexity Leadership Theory and network analysis, members of the project will study convergence research in action and design interventions to strengthen connections within the research team.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The connection between these areas is most visible in the Langlands program, which predicts relations between the roots of polynomials over number fields and the representations of algebraic groups; this connection is responsible for some of the most striking achievements in mathematics, such as the proof of Fermat's last theorem. Training the next generation of mathematicians in these areas is of vital importance to the country both because of the central role that they play in mathematics and because of important practical applications of these areas to topics such as cryptography, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. In recent years, there have been major developments in the field, including the theory of perfectoid spaces, the classification of automorphic representations, the geometry of numbers and arithmetic invariant theory, and the arithmetic theory of algebraic cycles.

A coordinated effort led by the Puerto Rico Science, Technology and Research Trust, in partnership with other organizations, will mobilize disparate and existing initiatives on the island that broaden the capability to adapt new knowledge while facilitating the development of partnerships to support a biopharmaceutical cluster engine that establishes a discovery-to-product value chain. The success of this engine is predicated on a steady pipeline of new medicines (discovery), innovative approaches to decentralized (sustainable) manufacturing, critical communication and energy (renewable) infrastructure, and key innovations in data-driven decision-making capability.<br/><br/>The award leverages the interactivity of all components of an ecosystem (e.g., policy, capital, R&D, markets, services, and social responsibility) to achieve sustained growth. The biopharma ecosystem needs to be transformed into more efficient, agile, smaller facilities ready for rapidly changing market conditions and leverage continuous flow manufacturing incorporating distributed manufacturing, blockchain, 5G, and artificial intelligence infrastructure. These assets will be leveraged to close the gap in the value chain of biopharmaceutical discovery to commercial production of medicines through infrastructure, capacity building, and training. The proposed effort will focus upon (and unify) a diverse coalition of experts from large corporations, academia, small companies, and incubators. If successful, the full NSF Engine resulting from this development award is expected to immediately have a measurable impact on the economy (with a contribution to GDP expected within the first five years of the concerted effort), equitably increase the number of jobs, and workforce training strategies to propel Puerto Rico to be the largest - and most agile - biopharma hub in the US. In addition, the approach will also include enhanced clinical trials, providing drug developers with coordinated access to Hispanic populations.

Specifically, in the manufacturing sector, IIoT systems are often deployed in harsh and complex environments and have to satisfy system-level dependability, timing performance, energy-efficiency, and security requirements. Moreover, IIoT technology can be leveraged to optimize the quality of products and the productivity of manufacturing lines and avoid process anomalies and faults that can lead to subpar performance and safety issues. However, these unique opportunities brought by IIoT pose challenges in their communication fabric design, distributed data management, analysis and decision making, and security protection. This CCRI planning proposal describes the planning activities underpinning the design of an innovative software-defined IIoT infrastructure to be jointly deployed at the three participating institutions, which will serve as a unified test-bed for a broad range of Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) researchers. It is envisioned that this proposed infrastructure will enable and support a large number of IIoT related research projects in the broader CISE community. It will vastly advance the adoption of IIoT technology, accelerate the transformation of legacy communication infrastructure to advanced networking and computing infrastructure, and boost the nation's economic growth and competitiveness.<br/><br/>The proposed novel IIoT community infrastructure is motivated by the observed limitations of existing IIoT test-beds in the research community. These limitations include (i) a lack of deployment in real-life manufacturing environments and (ii) the inability to support heterogeneous network structures and scalable network management and data analytics. To address these limitations, this project will utilize established community outreach venues to reach out to the relevant CISE research communities to best understand the community needs and their expectations for the proposed infrastructure.  The proposed IIoT community research infrastructure will be the first of its kind that (a) combines software-defined networking (SDN) backbone and software-defined radio (SDR)-based real-time wireless edge networks into a hybrid communication fabric to emulate a variety of industrial networking environments; (b) provides a hierarchical real-time computing platform for real-time IIoT system monitoring, analysis and decision making; and (c) organizes the edge computing facilities deployed at individual sites into a multi-site IIoT Blockchain network to support research on distributed data management technologies. The flexibility and configurability of the proposed infrastructure at both device and system levels will enable diverse communities of CISE researchers to access the test-bed, deploy their protocols, algorithms and applications, and experimentally validate new ideas and innovations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two fundamental performance measures of distributed algorithms are the running time and the number of messages used  by the algorithm. Research in the last three decades has focused to a large extent on optimizing  either one of the two measures separately, typically at the cost of the other. This project investigates how distributed algorithms can be designed to work well under both measures simultaneously. This may have significant implications in many emerging applications,  especially in the context of large-scale distributed communication networks and distributed processing of large-scale data.<br/><br/><br/>The project studies time-message tradeoffs in distributed algorithms for various specific fundamental problems, such as leader election, shortest paths,  minimum spanning tree construction, and random walks. These are fundamental primitives in distributed computing where optimizing both time and messages simultaneously has so far been elusive. Specific goals of the project are to: (1) design distributed algorithms that are optimal with respect to the other measure when given a particular value of one measure;  (2) obtain lower bounds on the complexity of one measure while fixing the other measure; (3) obtain  tradeoff relationships that characterizes the dependence of one measure on the other; and (4) obtain efficient distributed algorithms that operate on large-scale graphs. This research will yield efficient and scalable distributed algorithms with provable performance guarantees.

With the proliferation of large, distributed systems and computations such as Tor and blockchain, there is an urgent need for large-scale MPC to ensure security and privacy for these applications. However, large-scale applications pose some unique challenges for the design of MPC protocols. There are thousands of parties, often with unequal resources, and some number of parties are likely to fail during a protocol execution. This project proposes to design MPC protocols to address these challenges. The project?s novelties are the design of new MPC protocols satisfying the requirements of large-scale distributed applications. <br/><br/>Specifically, the investigators put forward a new framework for committee-based MPC for large-scale secure computations. These protocols distribute the computations across thousands of parallel committees to maximize the utilization of available resources for improved throughput. The designed protocols optimally choose committees and committee sub-protocols that optimize resource utilization and security. Additionally, they handle party failure and provide efficient oblivious access and search capabilities over data generated in these computations.  The team of researchers combines techniques from prior work on secure computation (MPC) and oblivious data structures to simultaneously achieve all of these goals.

However, the current distributed learning systems over IoT face inevitable challenges, mainly categorized into security, privacy, compatibility, and efficiency. For instance, first, the success of most existing learning systems relies heavily on a central server to coordinate the learning process. Second, traditional distributed learning requires the data on different devices to be in the same type/dimension. Third, the learning efficiency of the existing frameworks is another major concern. This work aims to systematically design a secure and fully decentralized learning method over IoT devices that enables the system to learn patterns from heterogenous data, i.e., data in different types/dimensions. This work will also deploy the developed method on a decentralized platform, i.e., blockchain, and design corresponding system protocols to eliminate the need to use a central server as in traditional distributed learning. On the other hand, the proposed system aims to exploit potential system vulnerabilities, develop attack and defense mechanisms, and theoretically analyze the system's reliability. Moreover, this work lays the groundwork for system research in dense IoT applications supported by decentralized learning. It generates preliminary experimental data necessary to develop an independent and competitive research agenda.<br/> <br/>This work will extend the traditional distributed/federated learning into a more general and practical scenario under IoT, where various types of data and IoT devices exist in the system.

The method for obtaining efficient implementations generates efficient message handlers from both general non-deterministic control and from quantifications over message histories, by systematically transforming expensive queries into efficient incremental computations. The method for correctness guarantees first translates DistAlgo to TLA+; next, to make the challenging verification tasks feasible, it uses appropriate formal verification tools like TLA Toolbox, to exploit high-level constructs in the specifications. The intellectual merits are a powerful and rigorous language that combines advantages of pseudocode languages, formal specification languages, and programming languages for distributed algorithms; advancement of a principled method for program optimization by incrementalization, the discrete counterpart of differentiation in calculus; and new technologies for formal verification of distributed algorithms."

Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) networks are one part of the smart grid to provide two-way communications between smart meters at the consumers' side and the utility companies. AMI networks allow utilities to collect power consumption data at high frequency rates. However, it needs too much communication bandwidth for smart meters to frequently send power consumption data even when the power consumption does not change. Since using cellular networks is one of the best options to AMI networks, the cost of sending this large amount of data is prohibitive. This project considers enhanced AMI networks, where the meters send power consumption data only when there is a significant change. This can significantly reduce the amount of bandwidth needed for sending the power consumption data; however, it creates a new privacy problem. Practical experiment results have confirmed that by observing the data transmission rate and using traffic analysis techniques, the attackers can infer sensitive information about consumers. Therefore, this new privacy problem must be studied and addressed, and strong countermeasures should be developed.<br/><br/>The proposed research systematically combines efforts from privacy, networking, and communication communities. The project promotes a research program designed to: (a) develop schemes for countering traffic analysis in AMI networks by considering different network and adversary models; (b) quantitatively measure the privacy protection provided by the schemes; and (c) evaluate the schemes in a prototype system for validating the proposed research and enabling hands-on experience for both undergraduate and graduate students. The project will significantly contribute to the research on smart grid, as well as computer system security and privacy. The proposed research will lead to a body of knowledge that can be leveraged by the designers of other networks. The proposed project also lends itself to teaching, training and learning of students.

With the proliferation of large, distributed systems and computations such as Tor and blockchain, there is an urgent need for large-scale MPC to ensure security and privacy for these applications. However, large-scale applications pose some unique challenges for the design of MPC protocols. There are thousands of parties, often with unequal resources, and a small number of parties are likely to fail during a protocol execution. This project proposes to design MPC protocols to address these challenges. The project?s novelties are the design of new MPC protocols satisfying the requirements of large-scale distributed applications. <br/><br/>Specifically, the investigators put forward a new framework for committee-based MPC for large-scale secure computations. These protocols distribute the computations across thousands of parallel committees to maximize the utilization of available resources for improved throughput. The designed protocols optimally choose committees and committee sub-protocols that optimize resource utilization and security. Additionally, they handle party failure and provide efficient oblivious access and search capabilities over data generated in these computations.  The team of researchers combines techniques from prior work on secure computation (MPC) and oblivious data structures to simultaneously achieve all of these goals.

Unfortunately, with declining trust in institutions, users find themselves in the perilous position of relying on computations they have little trust in. Fortunately, verifiable computation (VC), a rapidly emerging capability in computer science, provides a candidate solution. Instead of requiring users to blindly trust that their computations are correctly computed by others, users can verify that the correct computation was performed by inspecting a proof produced with the computation. There is a growing list of potential applications for VC including cloud offload, finance, untrusted chip fabrication, blockchain compression, and machine learning (ML). However, VC is currently impractical because generating the proofs is too computationally expensive.  Hardware acceleration is a natural solution to VC's astronomical computational demands, but rising hardware-design costs complicate the development of specialized hardware. This project attacks both problems by investigating novel hardware architectures to accelerate VC and agile hardware-design techniques to reduce design costs. The acceleration provided will make many more VC applications practical. Enabling the widespread use of VC benefits society, as users will be able to individually verify the integrity of computations that affect them. The new design techniques will be shared in an approachable course whose materials will be open-sourced and well documented. In addition, the project integrates educational efforts such as helping underrepresented college students strengthen their problem-solving skills as well as broadening the pool of students pursuing graduate study.<br/><br/>The immaturity of the VC research area complicates developing hardware acceleration in multiple ways, and this project is intended to solveee these challenges. First, VC is a diverse and rapidly moving field, which makes it unlikely that a single accelerator architecture will be able to support all approaches. Fortunately, many approaches reuse operations and computational patterns, so this project is creating a library of hardware generators that can serve as building blocks to construct the desired VC approaches. Second, since VC is so new, there is little architectural wisdom and nearly no prior work on hardware acceleration for VC. The flexibility and parameterizability of the generators enables expansive design space explorations to productively discover efficient architectures. Third, exploiting all of the opportunities for reuse requires non-trivial compositions of topologies, operators, and rich data types. The project is developing deep composition to raise the abstraction level of reuse without sacrificing efficiency.  The innovative architectures developed to handle the novel VC workload will empower future VC application research. The open-source library of building blocks for VC hardware accelerators will help kickstart a new research area. Creating a new research area in addition to the new course and outreach activities, will help broaden and grow the hardware-design community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This framework will be used both to understand and predict the behavior of the current system as well as to explore alternative, more resilient designs. The main challenge for research on cryptocurrencies is that these systems rely on an intricate interplay of three main components: cryptography, distributed systems, and incentive driven behavior. Accordingly, the project develops tools and techniques in all three categories and seek to find novel ways to unify and apply these tools in combination.

The I-Corps customer discovery activities will also provide useful insights into other potential markets for this project's cooling technology, confirming if there is a need/interest by other industries, such as lasers, concentrated solar photovoltaics, and thermoelectric products, among many potential markets that use liquid-cooling systems at some level. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is motivated by a technology that consists of an embedded microfluidic cooling layer that offers significantly enhanced heat removal capabilities when compared with current thermal hardware -- this is as a result of eliminating the thermal interfaces and heat spreaders commonly used in microelectronic devices. The heat removal is directly managed by bonding the microfluidic cooling layer to the silicon chip surface through a metallic joint. The resulting micro-cooling layer replaces the need for the heat spreader used in current technologies since the microstructures embedded in the cooling layer have the appropriate feature sizes and layout with an appropriate flow distribution through engineered manifolds for effective heat dissipation. This technology provides the capability of unlocking the clock frequency on micro-processing units by allowing the input of higher voltages to the computing cores, while also keeping the device temperature below design limits. Laboratory experimentation with these microfluidic cooling layers under a wide variety of operating conditions and refrigerants has demonstrated capabilities for removing heat fluxes of up to 500 W/cm2; a 5x increase when compared with the current maximum heat fluxes of commercial, high-end central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The security of each is derived from centralized authorities that are trusted to provide information about cryptographic keys or identities. When authorities behave correctly, each security infrastructure protects the underlying insecure system from attack. However, what happens if an authority abuses its power, or experiences a malfunction, misconfiguration, or a compromise by an external attacker?<br/><br/>This project is predicated on the observation that the scope, impact, and visibility of abuse by compromised authorities is determined by the architecture of a security infrastructure (e.g., the presence or absence of hierarchy, the scope of an authority's power, etc.).

To do this, the project will use cryptography and mechanism design to design architectures that make abuse easier to detect, or harder to execute.  The project has implications on the security of some of the Internet's most crucial systems, and also involves technology transfer to the practitioners involved in the standardization and adoption of Internet systems."

However, multi-tenancy in public clouds makes critical computing resources, such as processor, memory, I/O devices, and storage, shared among virtual machines that are operated by different users. The performance of applications running in public clouds, therefore, may be affected by their neighboring virtual machines due to contention on the shared computing resources. Nonetheless, existing cloud performance monitoring tools do not offer visibility into hardware resources; cloud users have no choice but to blindly run computations on these public services in the hope that the performance is not negatively affected, for instance, by the neighbor's resource-depleting applications. The lack of performance guarantees is a hurdle faced by all cloud users to fully embrace the economic benefit of cloud computing, and especially by those whose applications demand stability and predictability of the runtime environments. This proposed project aims to solve this problem by developing novel techniques that allow cloud users to monitor the resource contention on the physical cloud servers without the help of the cloud providers.  Specifically, the proposed work entails the design, implementation, and evaluation of self-monitoring virtual machines, which leverage the nested virtualization technology and side-channel analysis techniques to monitor the contention in shared computing resources and proactively migrate nested virtual machines to avoid severe performance degradation.<br/><br/>The project will make broader societal impacts in the following aspects: First, new education tools will be developed through the proposed project.

Smart contracts are widely believed to have strong security guarantees as they are immutable once deployed, not even the owner of the contract can change its code. However, a new type of smart contract, namely upgradeable smart contract (USC), allows developers to upgrade the logic of their smart contracts and practically breaks the security assumption. This special type of smart contract has become increasingly prominent and has been adopted by many major companies (e.g., Compound Finance and Opensea.io). Despite the importance, there exists no comprehensive research that studies the status quo of USCs in the wild and even worse, the emerging security risks that are associated with upgradeability. This project conducts a series of novel studies to discern the upgradeability of smart contracts in the real world. Specifically, it answers three essential research questions regarding the importance of USCs in the current market, different design patterns and their strengths and weaknesses, and more importantly, the real-world security risks with USCs. <br/><br/>To do so, this project pioneers a practical static analysis-based approach to effectively detect USCs based on intrinsic characteristics, and perform further automatic behavior and security analyses. To differentiate USC design patterns, this project develops a complete taxonomy that can systematically characterize USCs at both syntactic and semantic levels. Moreover, the investigator conducts the first extensive and large-scale study on USCs to uncover and report unique designs and security risks in the real world. Eventually, this project creates the first comprehensive USC dataset that facilitates future research in this emerging direction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the core of many such applications lies the notion of equilibria, which has been widely studied by game theorists and economists to model and predict the strategic behavior of selfish yet rational agents.  During the past decade, the computation of equilibria in both games and markets has been studied intensively and many of the exciting developments have brought new insights towards a much better understanding of equilibria.  At the same time, they opened up a window to many new research challenges.  The goal of the project is to explore some of the important directions and problems that have emerged in the new frontiers of equilibrium computation.  Research along directions pursued in the project will complement the already extensive literature in economics and social sciences on equilibria, by offering new perspectives through the lens of algorithms, approximation, and computational complexity.  In addition to curriculum development, mentoring PhD students, and involving undergraduate students in accessible projects, the PIs will actively pursue outreach activities and broadly disseminate results obtained in the project.<br/><br/>Some of the research directions that the PIs plan to explore include the following:  1) Deepen our understanding of the new exponential-time hypothesis for fixed-point computation employed by Rubinstein in his recent breakthrough, by exploring its connections with other natural conjectures on the exact complexity of fundamental equilibrium computation problems.  2) Explore connections between two problems that have been studied intensively in the literature, the problem of finding an approximate Nash equilibrium in an anonymous game with a polynomial precision and that in a two-player game with a constant precision.  3) Study the computation of equilibria in games and markets with a unique equilibrium.  Equilibrium as a prediction tool is more meaningful when a unique equilibrium exists.  4) Work towards a dichotomy theorem for Arrow-Debreu market equilibria that aims to classify every family of utilities into those that are easy to solve and those that are intractable."

This project will develop a new programmer-centric model for expressing rigorously, in a single framework, the isolation and consistency guarantees offered by geo-replicated storage systems. It will then leverage the new model to seek more efficient ways to implement these guarantees.<br/><br/>The project will proceed along three thrusts. First, it will seek to express isolation and consistency guarantees as properties of states that applications can observe, instead of relying on invisible histories of low-level read/write operations. Second, it will seek to overcome the current scalability bottlenecks that arise with slow or faulty servers, which have, to date, stifled industry's interest in deploying causally-consistent geo-replicated data stores. Third, it will leverage its unified treatment of consistency and isolation to support, for the first time, generic read/write transactions on top of a scalable consistent data store.<br/><br/>The project directly addresses the growing interest in both research and industry towards large-scale, transactional distributed systems.  By confronting key obstacles to scalability, it will contribute to  bring to industrial fruition over two decades of academic research on causal consistency.  Further, by establishing a common language to discuss consistency and isolation, it will enable more fruitful exchanges  between the systems and database research communities, who, because of their primary focus on, respectively, consistency and isolation, have often been talking past each other. The project, with its tight integration of both theoretical and experimental research, is ideally suited to introducing graduate and undergraduate students to research, and  will offer a new approach to teaching consistency and isolation in graduate and undergraduate courses in distributed computing.<br/><br/>The project outcomes (papers published, presentations, and a repository of the software and workloads used to demonstrate the results of the project) will be made available for download at the address http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/projects/CCC/, where they will be kept for five years."

It is hard to imagine the Internet without the extensive use of applied cryptographic protocols, e.g., protocols used to secure web and email. Such protocols use and depend on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is also key to the security of other open systems such as mobile networks, Internet of Things, and blockchains. PKI provides a critical security infrastructure to achieve confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. However, there have been many attacks exploiting vulnerabilities of the PKI itself; PKI, in contrast to other well-known cryptographic protocols, has no security proofs or even precise definitions of security goals. As a result, systems utilizing PKI may be vulnerable. The proposed research will define security goals for PKI schemes, present PKI schemes which provably meet these goals, and present practical and efficient implementations of PKI schemes. This research will also develop the necessary theoretical tools to define security goals of cryptographic protocols and to analyze their security. The outcomes of this research will have broad benefits. Developers will benefit from the availability of open-source, provably secure PKI systems, enabling security for real-world applications. End-users will benefit from improved security guarantees and privacy. Given the global role of the Internet, society at large will benefit from a strengthened, advanced security infrastructure and PKI ecosystem and from educational efforts which will raise awareness of the importance of these topics. Furthermore, this research will support the development of a diverse cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut and Trinity College through increased research opportunities, education, and mentoring and outreach efforts.<br/> <br/>Research efforts of this project, the results of which will significantly impact the theoretical and practical aspects of developing and deploying cryptographic protocols, are organized in three main areas: 1) Advancement of PKI theory:  to define a comprehensive set of formal PKI requirements, and to design and analyze schemes to produce provably secure PKI schemes; 2) Development of PKI systems with improved security guarantees: to design, develop, and standardize provably secure PKI designs that are practical and appropriate for real-world applications; 3) Development of a framework and tools to facilitate provable security for applied cryptographic protocols under realistic models: to build a comprehensive framework that supports composability and formal verification tools for rigorous specification and analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for a new approach stems from the proliferation of data-driven technology and cyber-physical systems that control physical devices, such as robots and manufacturing machines, and use information from widely disparate sources. The consequences of data exposure, breach, or corruption can lead to identity theft, property loss, or (increasingly) bodily harm.  Unfortunately, common approaches to protecting information are ad-hoc, buggy, and subject to a variety of attacks and failure modes. In contrast, the DataCapsule infrastructure provides a standardized approach to sequencing, securing every bit of information while also including explicit provenance (stating who generated it). DataCapsules may move freely from place to place in the network while retaining their integrity, thereby enabling secure computation at the edge of the network.  Further, this project investigates techniques to ease the transition of application writers from current practice to use of the DataCapsule infrastructure. The benefits of standardization around DataCapsules are many fold, including (1) more uniform application of best practices for data security; (2) secure edge computing infrastructures that fluidly interact with authorized entities in the core of the network (cloud); and (3) an opportunity for new networking environments that respect information privacy and security while optimizing for performance and quality of service.<br/><br/>This project explores the use of DataCapsules to improve the security and performance of robotic and machine-learning applications operating in edge computing environments. DataCapsules are secured bundles of information with unique, self-certifying names that are transported over a data-centric 'narrow-waist' infrastructure called the Global Data Plane (GDP). This project investigates the design of DataCapsules as well as an architecture for the GDP that provides flat-address routing from authorized clients to DataCapsules, allowing DataCapsules to be replicated and reside anywhere within the GDP.  DataCapsules consist of standardized metadata wrappers anchoring hash-chain-linked histories of transactions labeled by signatures. As universal 'ground-truths' for data storage applications, DataCapsules share some advantages of block-chains, including publicly verifiable integrity. Above the DataCapsule layer, application writers benefit from uniform security while continuing to utilize common storage access patterns, such as filesystems, databases, and key-value stores. The GDP partitions the network into Trust Domains (TDs) to allow clients to reason about the trustworthiness of hardware. This architecture includes overlay switches connected via a tunneling protocol and a scalable location resolution infrastructure. Each TD is responsible for a subset of the DataCapsules and provides data location facilities that serve 'location delegation' certificates (mapping names to network locations) for these DataCapsules. For scalability, this project investigates several name resolution mechanisms, including one based on distributed hash table (DHT) principles. This project also utilizes secure enclave technologies (e.g. Intel SGX) to provide secure computation at the edge of the network.  By promoting best practice labeling and secure management of information, the DataCapsule infrastructure promises to lead to an overall reduction in data breaches and safer public and private cyberspace infrastructure. Further, it will allow application writers to trust the security of information at the edge of the network, thus leading to new and better application of data-driven techniques at the network edge while simultaneously improving privacy; this, in turn, will lead to better applications, such as robotic and smart manufacturing.  Finally,  in addition to educational activities, the project, in collaboration with the University of California Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science, will produce open-access videos to raise awareness of information vulnerability and provenance with youth and the public at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These roles include actively defending computer systems, analyzing malicious software involved in attacks, investigation and attribution, cybersecurity education, and more. Unfortunately, demand currently far exceeds the supply of highly qualified cybersecurity professionals. One of the most pressing needs is in the federal sector, where salaries are often lower than in the commercial sector. Compounding this problem is the fact that many students are unaware of the interesting job opportunities available in the federal government. This project will provide scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students studying cybersecurity at Louisiana State University (LSU). Students will receive a solid education in cybersecurity, marketable skills, and exposure to cybersecurity opportunities available in the federal government. Recruiting students from populations currently underrepresented in the cybersecurity workforce, including women and minorities, will be a priority. This project will support the expansion of the cybersecurity workforce in the United States while nurturing highly-qualified cybersecurity students and enabling each of them to make a personal impact in a field that is critically important to national security.<br/><br/>LSU has a strong cybersecurity program that offers students the opportunity to study a variety of topics in applied cybersecurity and to conduct research using state-of-the-art facilities. The project will offer scholarships to 21 students over a five-year period to participate in an intensive academic program in cybersecurity, which includes several important activities.  These activities will include both coursework and research in cutting-edge areas such as memory forensics, reverse engineering, malware analysis, blockchains, machine learning, and network security. Students will also participate in a federal internship program and obtain at least one cybersecurity certification.<br/>  <br/>This project is supported by the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) program, which funds proposals establishing or continuing scholarship programs in cybersecurity and aligns with the U.S. National Cyber Strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce.

It is hard to imagine the Internet without the extensive use of applied cryptographic protocols, e.g., protocols used to secure web and email. Such protocols use and depend on the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is also key to the security of other open systems such as mobile networks, Internet of Things, and blockchains. PKI provides a critical security infrastructure to achieve confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation. However, there have been many attacks exploiting vulnerabilities of the PKI itself; PKI, in contrast to other well-known cryptographic protocols, has no security proofs or even precise definitions of security goals. As a result, systems utilizing PKI may be vulnerable. The proposed research will define security goals for PKI schemes, present PKI schemes which provably meet these goals, and present practical and efficient implementations of PKI schemes. This research will also develop the necessary theoretical tools to define security goals of cryptographic protocols and to analyze their security. The outcomes of this research will have broad benefits. Developers will benefit from the availability of open-source, provably secure PKI systems, enabling security for real-world applications. End-users will benefit from improved security guarantees and privacy. Given the global role of the Internet, society at large will benefit from a strengthened, advanced security infrastructure and PKI ecosystem and from educational efforts which will raise awareness of the importance of these topics. Furthermore, this research will support the development of a diverse cohort of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut and Trinity College through increased research opportunities, education, and mentoring and outreach efforts.<br/> <br/>Research efforts of this project, the results of which will significantly impact the theoretical and practical aspects of developing and deploying cryptographic protocols, are organized in three main areas: 1) Advancement of PKI theory:  to define a comprehensive set of formal PKI requirements, and to design and analyze schemes to produce provably secure PKI schemes; 2) Development of PKI systems with improved security guarantees: to design, develop, and standardize provably secure PKI designs that are practical and appropriate for real-world applications; 3) Development of a framework and tools to facilitate provable security for applied cryptographic protocols under realistic models: to build a comprehensive framework that supports composability and formal verification tools for rigorous specification and analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exploring the limits of this idea in these abstract settings can lead to new understanding, which enables technological innovation. <br/><br/>It has been long known in mathematics that studying the invariances (symmetries) of an object has an important role in understanding the object. In recent years, the study of invariances has led to some significant  advances in various topics in theoretical computer science, such as property testing, error-correcting codes and complexity theory.  For example, codes with affine invariance and codes with a transitive invariance group  have been shown to have important applications in complexity theory, such as constructing PCPs.  This project will support the travel of the PIs and their students for research collaborations on these topics with collaborators in Israel. This research will deepen our understanding of objects with invariances, and develop new applications of this theory in complexity theory."
